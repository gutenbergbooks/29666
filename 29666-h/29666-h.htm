<h3>Foreword</h3>
<p>This book deals with a subject which is new to most English
readers. For though Danish hymnody long ago became favorably
known in Northern Europe, no adequate presentation of the subject
has appeared in English. Newer American Lutheran hymnals
contain a number of Danish hymns, some of which have gained
considerable popularity, but the subject as a whole has not been
presented.</p>
<p>A hymn is a child both of its author and of the time in which
he lived. A proper knowledge of the writer and the age that gave
it birth will enhance our understanding both of the hymn and of
the spiritual movement it represents. No other branches of literature
furnish a more illuminating index to the inner life of Christendom
than the great lyrics of the Church. Henry Ward Beecher
said truly: &ldquo;He who knows the way that hymns flowed, knows
where the blood of true piety ran, and can trace its veins and
arteries to its very heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aside from whatever value they may have in themselves, the
hymns presented on the following pages therefore should convey
an impression of the main currents within the Danish church, and
the men that helped to create them.</p>
<p>The names of Kingo, Brorson and Grundtvig are known to
many, but so far no biographies of these men except of the sketchiest
kind have appeared in English. It is hoped that the fairly
comprehensive presentation of their life and work in the following
pages may fill a timely need.</p>
<p>In selecting the hymns care has been taken to choose those
that are most characteristic of their authors, their times and the
<span class="pb" id="pg_6">[6]</span>
movements out of which they were born. While the translator has
sought to produce faithfully the metre, poetry and sentiment of
the originals, he has attempted no slavishly literal reproduction.
Many of the finest Danish hymns are frankly lyrical, a fact which
greatly increases the difficulty of translation. But while the
writer is conscious that his translations at times fail to reproduce
the full beauty of the originals, he still hopes that they may convey
a fair impression of these and constitute a not unworthy contribution
to American hymnody.</p>
<p>An examination of any standard American church hymnal
will prove that American church song has been greatly enriched
by transplantations of hymns from many lands and languages.
If the following contribution from a heretofore meagerly represented
branch of hymnody adds even a little to that enrichment,
the writer will feel amply rewarded for the many hours of concentrated
labor he has spent upon it.</p>
<p>Most of the translations are by the writer himself. When translations
by others have been used, credit has been given to them
except where only parts of a hymn have been presented.</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_9">[9]</div>
<h4>Chapter One
<span class="chaptertitle">Early Danish Hymnody</span></h4>
<p>Danish hymnody, like that of other Protestant countries,
is largely a child of the Reformation. The Northern peoples
were from ancient times lovers of song. Much of their early
history is preserved in poetry, and no one was more honored
among them than the skjald who most skillfully presented their
thoughts and deeds in song. Nor was this love of poetry lost with
the transition from paganism to Christianity. The splendid folk
songs of the Middle Ages prove conclusively that both the love of
poetry and the skill in writing it survived into the new age. One
can only wonder what fine songs the stirring advent of Christianity
might have produced among a people so naturally gifted in
poetry if the church had encouraged rather than discouraged this
native gift.</p>
<p>But the Church of Rome evinced little interest in the ancient
ways of the people among whom she took root. Her priests received
their training in a foreign tongue; her services were conducted
in Latin; and the native language and literature were
neglected. Except for a few lawbooks, the seven hundred years
of Catholic supremacy in Denmark did not produce a single book
in the Danish language. The ordinances of the church, furthermore,
expressly forbade congregational singing at the church services,
holding that, since it was unlawful for the laity to preach,
it was also impermissible for them to sing in the sanctuary. It is
thus likely that a Danish hymn had never been sung, except on a
<span class="pb" id="pg_10">[10]</span>
few special occasions in a Danish church before the triumph of the
Reformation.</p>
<p>It is not likely, however, that this prohibition of hymn singing
could be effectively extended to the homes or occasional private
gatherings. Hans Thomisson, who compiled the most important
of the early Danish hymnals, thus includes five &ldquo;old hymns&rdquo; in his
collection with the explanation that he had done so to show &ldquo;that
even during the recent times of error there were pious Christians
who, by the grace of God, preserved the true Gospel. And though
these songs were not sung in the churches&mdash;which were filled with
songs in Latin that the people did not understand&mdash;they were sung
in the homes and before the doors&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Most of these earlier hymns no doubt were songs to the Virgin
Mary or legendary hymns, two types of songs which were then
very common and popular throughout the church. Of the few real
hymns in use, some were composed with alternating lines of Danish
and Latin, indicating that they may have been sung responsively.
Among these hymns we find the oldest known Danish Christmas
hymn, which, in the beautiful recast of Grundtvig, is still one of
the most favored Christmas songs in Danish.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Christmas with gladness sounds,</p>
<p class="t0">Joy abounds</p>
<p class="t0">When praising God, our Father,</p>
<p class="t0">We gather.</p>
<p class="t0">We were in bondage lying,</p>
<p class="t0">But He hath heard our prayer.</p>
<p class="t0">Our inmost need supplying,</p>
<p class="t0">He sent the Savior here.</p>
<p class="t0">Therefore with praises ringing,</p>
<p class="t0">Our hearts for joy are singing:</p>
<p class="t">All Glory, praise and might</p>
<p class="t">Be God&rsquo;s for Christmas night.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Right in a golden year,</p>
<p class="t0">Came He here.</p>
<p class="t0">Throughout a world confounded</p>
<p class="t0">Resounded</p>
<p class="t0">The tidings fraught with gladness</p>
<p class="t0">For every tribe of man</p>
<p class="t0">That He hath borne our sadness</p>
<p class="t0">And brought us joy again,</p>
<p class="t0">That He in death descended,</p>
<p class="t0">Like sun when day is ended,</p>
<p class="t">And rose on Easter morn</p>
<p class="t">With life and joy reborn.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_11">[11]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He hath for every grief</p>
<p class="t0">Brought relief.</p>
<p class="t0">Each grateful heart His praises</p>
<p class="t0">Now raises.</p>
<p class="t0">With angels at the manger,</p>
<p class="t0">We sing the Savior&rsquo;s birth,</p>
<p class="t0">Who wrought release from danger</p>
<p class="t0">And peace to man on earth,</p>
<p class="t0">Who satisfies our yearning,</p>
<p class="t0">And grief to joy is turning</p>
<p class="t">Till we with Him arise</p>
<p class="t">And dwell in Paradise.</p>
</div>
<p>The earliest Danish texts were translations from the Latin. Of
these the fine translations of the well known hymns, &ldquo;Stabat Mater
Dolorosa&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Dies Est Laetitia in Ortu Regali&rdquo;, are still used, the
latter especially in Grundtvig&rsquo;s beautiful recast &ldquo;Joy is the Guest
of Earth Today&rdquo;.</p>
<p>At a somewhat later period, but still well in advance of the
Reformation, the first original Danish hymns must have appeared.
Foremost among these, we may mention the splendid hymns, &ldquo;I
Will Now Hymn His Praises Who All My Sin Hath Borne&rdquo;, &ldquo;On
Mary, Virgin Undefiled, Did God Bestow His Favor&rdquo;, and the
beautiful advent hymn, &ldquo;O Bride of Christ, Rejoice&rdquo;, all hymns that
breathe a truly Evangelical spirit and testify to a remarkable skill
in the use of a language then so sorely neglected.</p>
<p>Best known of all Pre-Reformation songs in Danish is &ldquo;The
Old Christian Day Song&rdquo;&mdash;the name under which it was printed
by Hans Thomisson. Of the three manuscript copies of this song,
which are preserved in the library of Upsala, Sweden, the oldest
is commonly dated at &ldquo;not later than 1450&rdquo;. The song itself, however,
is thought to be much older, dating probably from the latter
part of the 14th century. Its place of origin is uncertain, with both
Sweden and Denmark contending for the honor. The fact that the
text printed by Hans Thomisson is identical, except for minor variations
in dialect, with that of the oldest Swedish manuscript
proves, at least, that the same version was also current in Danish,
and that no conclusion as to its origin can now be drawn from the
chance preservation of its text in Sweden. The following translation
is based on Grundtvig&rsquo;s splendid revision of the song for the
thousand years&rsquo; festival of the Danish church.<sup><a id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_12">[12]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">With gladness we hail the blessed day</p>
<p class="t0">Now out of the sea ascending,</p>
<p class="t0">Illuming the earth upon its way</p>
<p class="t0">And cheer to all mortals lending.</p>
<p class="t0">God grant that His children everywhere</p>
<p class="t0">May prove that the night is ending.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">How blest was that wondrous midnight hour</p>
<p class="t0">When Jesus was born of Mary!</p>
<p class="t0">Then dawned in the East with mighty power</p>
<p class="t0">The day that anew shall carry</p>
<p class="t0">The light of God&rsquo;s grace to every soul</p>
<p class="t0">That still with the Lord would tarry.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Should every creature in song rejoice,</p>
<p class="t0">And were every leaflet singing,</p>
<p class="t0">They could not His grace and glory voice,</p>
<p class="t0">Though earth with their praise were ringing,</p>
<p class="t0">For henceforth now shines the Light of Life,</p>
<p class="t0">Great joy to all mortals bringing.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Like gold is the blush of morning bright,</p>
<p class="t0">When day has from death arisen.</p>
<p class="t0">Blest comfort too holds the peaceful night</p>
<p class="t0">When skies in the sunset glisten.</p>
<p class="t0">So sparkle the eyes of those whose hearts</p>
<p class="t0">In peace for God&rsquo;s summons listen.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Then journey we to our fatherland,</p>
<p class="t0">Where summer reigns bright and vernal.</p>
<p class="t0">Where ready for us God&rsquo;s mansions stand</p>
<p class="t0">With thrones in their halls supernal.</p>
<p class="t0">So happily there with friends of light</p>
<p class="t0">We joy in the peace eternal.</p>
</div>
<p>In this imperishable song, Pre-Reformation hymnody reached
its highest excellence, an excellence that later hymnody seldom
has surpassed. &ldquo;The Old Christian Day Song&rdquo; shows, besides, that
Northern hymnwriters even &ldquo;during the time of popery&rdquo; had
caught the true spirit of Evangelical hymnody. Their songs were
few, and they were often bandied about like homeless waifs, but
they embodied the purest Christian ideals of that day and served
in a measure to link the old church with the new.</p>

<h4>Chapter Two
<span class="chaptertitle">Reformation Hymnody</span></h4>
<p>The Danish Reformation began quietly about 1520, and
culminated peacefully in the establishment of the Lutheran
church as the church of the realm in 1536. The movement was
not, as in some other countries, the work of a single outstanding
reformer. It came rather as an almost spontaneous uprising of the
people under several independent leaders, among whom men like
Hans Tausen, Jorgen Sadolin, Claus Mortensen, Hans Spandemager
and others merely stand out as the most prominent. And it was
probably this very spontaneity which invested the movement with
such an irresistible force that within in a few years it was able to
overthrow an establishment that had exerted a powerful influence
over the country for more than seven centuries.</p>
<p>In this accomplishment Evangelical hymnody played a prominent
part. Though the Reformation gained little momentum before
1526, the Papists began as early as 1527, to preach against &ldquo;the
sacrilegious custom of roaring Danish ballads at the church service&rdquo;.
As no collection of hymns had then been published, the
hymns thus used must have been circulated privately, showing the
eagerness of the people to adopt the new custom. The leaders of
the Reformation were quick to recognize the new interest and make
use of it in the furtherance of their cause. The first Danish hymnal
was published at Malm&oslash; in 1528 by Hans Mortensen. It contained
ten hymns and a splendid liturgy for the morning service. This
small collection proved so popular that it was soon enlarged by
the addition of thirty new hymns and appropriate liturgies for the
various other services, that were held on the Sabbath day. Independent
collections were almost simultaneously published by Hans
Tausen, Arvid Petersen and others. And, as these different collections
all circulated throughout the country, the result was confusing.
At a meeting in Copenhagen of Evangelical leaders from
all parts of the country, it was decided to revise the various collections
and to combine them into one hymnal. This first common
hymnal for the Danish church appeared in 1531, and served as the
hymnal of the church till 1544, when it was revised and enlarged
by Hans Tausen. Tausen&rsquo;s hymnal was replaced in 1569 by <b>The
Danish Psalmbook</b>, compiled by Hans Thomisson, a pastor of the
<span class="pb" id="pg_14">[14]</span>
Church of Our Lady at Copenhagen, and the ablest translator and
hymnwriter of the Reformation period. <b>Hans Thomisson&rsquo;s Hymnal</b>&mdash;as
it was popularly named&mdash;was beyond question the finest
hymnal of the transition period. It was exceptionally well printed,
contained 268 hymns, set to their appropriate tunes, and served
through innumerable reprints as the hymnal of the Danish church
for more than 150 years.</p>

</div>
<p>Thus the Reformation, in less than fifty years, had produced an
acceptable hymnal and had established congregational singing as
an indispensable part of the church service. The great upheaval
had failed, nevertheless, to produce a single hymnwriter of outstanding
merit. The leaders in the movement were able men,
striving earnestly to satisfy a pressing need. But they were not
poets. Their work consisted of passable translations, selections
from Pre-Reformation material and a few original hymns by Claus
Mortensen, Arvid Petersen, Hans Thomisson and others. It represented
an honest effort, but failed to attain greatness. People loved
their new hymns, however, and clung to them despite their halting
metres and crude style, even when newer and much finer songs
<span class="pb" id="pg_15">[15]</span>
were available. But when these at last had gained acceptance, the
old hymns gradually disappeared, and very few of them are now
included in the Danish hymnal. The Reformation produced a
worthy hymnal, but none of the great hymnwriters whose splendid
work later won Danish hymnody an honorable place in the church.</p>
<p>Hans Chrestensen Sthen, the first notable hymnwriter of the
Danish church, was already on the scene, however, when Hans
Thomisson&rsquo;s Hymnal left the printers. He is thought to have been
born at Roskilde about 1540; but neither the date nor the place
of his birth is now known with certainty. He is reported to have
been orphaned at an early age, and subsequently, to have been
adopted and reared by the renowned Royal Chamberlain, Christopher
Walkendorf. After receiving an excellent education, he became
rector of a Latin school at Helsing&oslash;r, the Elsinore of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
<b>Hamlet</b>, and later was appointed to a pastorate in the
same city. In this latter office he was singularly successful. Lysander,
one of his biographers, says of him that he was exceptionally
well educated, known as a fine orator and noted as a successful
author and translator. His hymns prove that he was also an earnest
and warm-hearted Christian. The peoples of Helsing&oslash;r loved him
dearly, and for many years, after he had left their city, continued
to &ldquo;remember him with gifts of love for his long and faithful service
among them&rdquo;. In 1583, to the sorrow of his congregation he
had accepted a call to Malm&oslash;, a city on the eastern shore of the
Sound. But in this new field his earnest Evangelical preaching,
provoked the resentment of a number of his most influential parishioners,
who, motivated by a wish to blacken his name and secure
his removal, instigated a suit against him for having mismanaged
an inheritance left to his children by his first wife. The children
themselves appeared in his defence, however, and expressed
their complete satisfaction with his administration of their property;
and the trumped up charge was wholly disproved. But his
enemies still wanted to have him removed and, choosing a new
method of attack, forwarded a petition to the king in which they
claimed that &ldquo;Master Hans Chrestensen Sthen because of weakness
and old age was incompetent to discharge his duties as a pastor&rdquo;,
and asked for his removal to the parishes of Tygelse and Klagstrup.
Though the king is reported to have granted the petition,
other things seem to have intervened to prevent its execution, and
the ill-used pastor appears to have remained at Malm&oslash; until his
death, the date of which is unknown.</p>
<p>Sthen&rsquo;s fame as a poet and hymnwriter rests mainly on two
<span class="pb" id="pg_16">[16]</span>
thin volumes of poetry. <b>A Small Handbook, Containing Diverse
Prayers and Songs Together with Some Rules for Life, Composed
in Verse</b>, which appeared in 1578, and <b>A Small Wander Book</b>,
published in 1591. The books contain both a number of translations
and some original poems. In some of the latter Sthen readopts
the style of the old folk songs with their free metre, native imagery
and characteristic refrain. His most successful compositions in
this style are his fine morning and evening hymns, one of which
is given below.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The gloomy night to morning yields,</p>

</div>
<p>Sthen&rsquo;s hymns all breathe a meek and lowly spirit. They express
in the simplest words the faith, hope and fears of a humble,
earnest Christian. The following still beloved hymn thus presents
a vivid picture of the meek and prayerful spirit of its author.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Lord, my heart is turning</p>
<p class="t0">To Thee with ceaseless yearning</p>
<p class="t0">And praying for Thy grace.</p>

</div>
<p>Most widely known of all Sthen&rsquo;s hymns is his beloved &ldquo;Lord
Jesus Christ, My Savior Blest&rdquo;. In its unabbreviated form this
hymn contains eight stanzas of which the initial letters spell the
words: &ldquo;Hans Anno&rdquo;; and it has become known therefore as
&ldquo;Sthen&rsquo;s Name Hymn&rdquo;. The method of thus affixing one&rsquo;s name
to a song was frequently practiced by authors for the purpose of
impressing people with their erudition. The meek and anxious
spirit that pervades this hymn makes it unlikely, however, that
Sthen would have employed his undoubted skill as a poet for such
a purpose. The hymn is thought to have been written at Malm&oslash;
at the time its author encountered his most severe trials there.
And its intimate personal note makes it likely that he thus ineradicably
affixed his name to his hymn in order to indicate its
connection with his own faith and experience. &ldquo;Sthen&rsquo;s Name
Hymn&rdquo; thus should be placed among the numerous great hymns
of the church that have been born out of the sorrows and travails
of their authors&rsquo; believing but anxious hearts. The translation
given below is from the abbreviated text now used in all Danish
hymnals.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
<p class="t0">My Savior blest,</p>
<p class="t0">My refuge and salvation,</p>

<p class="t0">When grief and stress</p>
<p class="t0">My heart oppress,</p>

</div>
<p>With Sthen the fervid spirit of the Reformation period appears
to have spent itself. The following century added nothing to Danish
hymnody. Anders Chrestensen Arrebo, Bishop at Tronhjem,
and an ardent lover and advocate of a richer cultivation of the
Danish language and literature, published a versification of the
Psalms of David and a few hymns in 1623. But the Danish church
never became a psalm singing church, and his hymns have disappeared.
Hans Thomisson&rsquo;s hymnal continued to be printed with
occasional additions of new material, most of which possessed no
permanent value. But the old hymns entered into the very heart
and spirit of the people and held their affection so firmly that even
Kingo lost much of his popularity when he attempted to revise
them and remove some of their worst poetical and linguistic defects.
They were no longer imprinted merely on the pages of a
book but in the very heart and affection of a nation.</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_21">[21]</div>
<h4>Chapter Three
<span class="chaptertitle">Kingo&rsquo;s Childhood and Youth</span></h4>
<p>Thomas Kingo, the first of the great Danish hymnwriters,
grew forth as a root out of dry ground. There was nothing
in the religious and secular life of the times to foreshadow
the appearance of one of the great hymnwriters, not only of Denmark
but of the world.</p>
<p>The latter part of the 16th and the first half of the 17th centuries
mark a rather barren period in the religious and cultural
life of Denmark. The spiritual ferment of the Reformation had
subsided into a staid and uniform Lutheran orthodoxy. Jesper
Brochman, a bishop of Sj&aelig;lland and the most famous theologian
of that age, praised king Christian IV for &ldquo;the zeal with which from
the beginning of his reign he had exerted himself to make all his
subjects think and talk alike about divine things&rdquo;. That the foremost
leader of the church thus should recommend an effort to
impose uniformity upon the church by governmental action proves
to what extent church life had become stagnant. Nor did such
secular culture as there was present a better picture. The Reformation
had uprooted much of the cultural life that had grown up
during the long period of Catholic supremacy, but had produced
no adequate substitute. Even the once refreshing springs of the
folk-sings had dried up. Writers were laboriously endeavoring to
master the newer and more artistic forms of poetry introduced
from other countries, but when the forms had been achieved the
spirit had often fled, leaving only an empty shell. Of all that was
written during these years only one song of any consequence,
&ldquo;Denmark&rsquo;s Lovely Fields and Meadows&rdquo;, has survived.</p>
<p>Against this bleak background the work of Kingo stands out
<span class="pb" id="pg_22">[22]</span>
as an amazing achievement. Leaping all the impediments of an
undeveloped language and an equally undeveloped form, Danish
poetry by one miraculous sweep attained a perfection which later
ages have scarcely surpassed.</p>
<div class="img" title="Thomas Kingo">

<p class="center">Thomas Kingo</p>
</div>
<p>Of this accomplishment, Grundtvig wrote two hundred years
later: &ldquo;Kingo&rsquo;s hymns represent not only the greatest miracle of
the 17th century but such an exceptional phenomenon in the realm
of poetry that it is explainable only by the fates who in their wisdom
preserved the seed of an Easter Lily for a thousand years,
and then returned it across the sea that it might flower in its original
soil&rdquo;. Kingo&rsquo;s family on the paternal side had immigrated to
Denmark from that part of Scotland which once had been settled
by the poetic Northern sea rovers, and Grundtvig thus conceives
the poetic genius of Kingo to be a revival of an ancestral gift,
brought about by the return of his family to its original home and
a new infusion of pure Northern blood. The conception, like so
much that Grundtvig wrote is at least ingenious, and it is recommended
<span class="pb" id="pg_23">[23]</span>
by the fact that Kingo&rsquo;s poetry does convey a spirit of
robust realism that is far more characteristic of the age of the Vikings
than of his own.</p>
<p>Thomas Kingo, the grandfather of the poet, immigrated from
Crail, Scotland, to Denmark about 1590, and settled at Helsing&oslash;r,
Sj&aelig;lland, where he worked as a tapestry weaver. He seems to have
attained a position of some prominence, and it is related that King
James IV of Scotland, during a visit to Helsing&oslash;r, lodged at his
home. His son, Hans Thomeson Kingo, who was about two years
old when the family arrived in Denmark, does not appear to have
prospered as well as his father. He learned the trade of linen and
damask weaving, and established a modest business of his own at
Slangerup, a town in the northern part of Sj&aelig;lland and close to
the famous royal castle of Frederiksborg. At the age of thirty-eight
he married a young peasant girl, Karen S&oslash;rendatter, and
built a modest but eminently respectable home. In this home,
Thomas Kingo, the future hymnwriter, was born December 15, 1634.</p>
<p>It was an unusually cold and unfriendly world that greeted
the advent of the coming poet. The winter of his birth was long
remembered as one of the hardest ever experienced in Denmark.
The country&rsquo;s unsuccessful participation in the Thirty Year&rsquo;s War
had brought on a depression that threatened its very existence as
a nation; and a terrible pestilence followed by new wars increased
and prolonged the general misery, making the years of Kingo&rsquo;s
childhood and youth one of the darkest periods in Danish history.</p>
<p>But although these conditions brought sorrow and ruin to
thousands, even among the wealthy, the humble home of the
Kingos somehow managed to survive. Beneath its roof industry
and frugality worked hand in hand with piety and mutual love to
brave the storms that wrecked so many and apparently far stronger
establishments. Kingo always speaks with the greatest respect
and gratitude of his &ldquo;poor but honest parents&rdquo;. In a poetic description
of his childhood years he vividly recalls their indulgent
kindness to him.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I took my pilgrim staff in hand</p>
<p class="t0">Ere I attempted talking;</p>
<p class="t0">I had scarce left my swaddling-band</p>
<p class="t0">Before they set me walking.</p>
<p class="t0">They coached me onward with a smile</p>
<p class="t0">And suited me when tearful.</p>
<p class="t0">One step was farther than a mile,</p>
<p class="t0">For I was small and fearful.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_24">[24]</div>
<p>But discipline was not forgotten. Parents in those days usually
kept the rod close to the apple, often too close. And Kingo&rsquo;s parents,
despite their kindness, made no exception to the rule. He
was a lively, headstrong boy in need of a firm hand, and the hand
was not wanting.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">As a child my daily bread</p>
<p class="t0">I with rod and penance had,</p>
</div>
<p>he wrote later, adding that the fruits of that chastisement are now
sweet to him. Nor do his parents ever appear to have treated him
with the cold, almost loveless austerity that so many elders frequently
felt it their duty to adopt toward their children. Their
discipline was tempered by kindness and an earnest Christian
faith. Although Hans Kingo seems to some extent to have been
influenced by the strict Presbyterianism of his Scotch forebears,
he does not appear, like so many followers of that stern faith, to
have taught his children to believe in God as the strict judge rather
than as the loving Father of Jesus Christ. In his later years the
son at least gives us an attractive picture of his childhood faith:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I gratefully remember</p>
<p class="t0">God&rsquo;s loving care for me</p>
<p class="t0">Since from my nursery chamber</p>
<p class="t0">I toddled fearfully.</p>
<p class="t0">I lived contented in His care</p>
<p class="t0">And trusted in His children&rsquo;s prayer.</p>
</div>
<p>These bright years of his happy childhood were somewhat darkened,
however, when, at the age of six, he entered the Danish and,
two years later, the Latin school of his home town. Nothing could
be more unsuited for a child of tender years than the average
school of those days. The curriculum was meager, the teaching
poor and the discipline cruel. Every day saw its whipping scenes.
For a day&rsquo;s unexplained absence the punishment for the smaller
boys was three lashes on their bare seats and for the larger an
equal number on their bare backs. For graver offences up to
twenty lashes might be administered. On entering the Latin school
every boy had to adopt a new language. Only Latin could be
spoken within its classical confines; and woe be to the tike who so
far forgot himself as to speak a word in the native tongue anywhere
upon the school premises. The only way anyone, discovered
to have perpetrated such a crime, could escape the severest punishment
was to report another culprit guilty of the same offense.
Under such conditions one cannot wonder that Kingo complains:</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_25">[25]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The daily round from home to school</p>
<p class="t0">Was often hard and weary.</p>
<p class="t0">It did my youthful ardour cool</p>
<p class="t0">And made my childhood dreary.</p>
</div>
<p>At the age of fifteen Kingo, for reasons now unknown, was
transferred from the school of his home town to that at the neighboring
city of Hiller&oslash;d. Here, on account of his outstanding ability,
he was accepted into the home of his new rector, Albert Bartholin,
a young man of distinguished family and conspicuous personal
endowments.</p>
<p>Although the school at Hiller&oslash;d was larger, it probably was
not much better than that at Slangerup; but the close association
of the humble weaver&rsquo;s son with his distinguished rector and his
refined family, no doubt, was a distinct advantage to him. The
location of Hiller&oslash;d on the shores of the idyllic Frederiksborg Lake
and close to the magnificent castle of the same name is one of the
loveliest in Denmark. The castle had recently been rebuilt, and
presented, together with its lovely surroundings, a most entrancing
spectacle. Its famous builder, Christian IV, had just gone the
way of all flesh; but the new king, Frederik, known for his fondness
for royal pomp, frequently resided at the castle together with
his court, and thus Kingo must often have enjoyed the opportunity
to see both the king and the outstanding men of his government.</p>
<p>It is not unlikely that this near view of the beauty and splendor
of his country, the finest that Denmark had to offer, served
to awaken in Kingo that ardent love for all things Danish for which
he is noticed. While still at Hiller&oslash;d he, at any rate, commenced a
comprehensive study of Danish literature, a most unusual thing
for a young student to do at a time when German was the common
language of all the upper classes and Danish was despised as the
speech of traders and peasants. As neither his school nor the general
sentiment of the intellectual classes did anything to encourage
interest in native culture, some other influence must have aroused
in the young Kingo what one of his early biographers calls &ldquo;his
peculiar inclination for his native tongue and Danish poetry&rdquo;. A
few patriotic and forward looking men, it is true, had risen above
the general indifference and sought to inspire a greater interest
in the use and cultivation of the Danish language; but this work
was still very much in its infancy, and it is not likely that the
young Kingo knew much about it.</p>
<p>He graduated from Hiller&oslash;d in the spring of 1654, and enrolled
<span class="pb" id="pg_26">[26]</span>
at the university of Copenhagen on May 6 of the same year. But
a terrific outbreak of the plague forced the university to close on
May 30, and Kingo returned to his home. The scourge raged for
about eight months, carrying away one third of the city&rsquo;s population,
and it was winter before Kingo returned to the school and
enrolled in the department of theology. The rules of the university
required each student, at the beginning of his course, to choose a
preceptor, a sort of guardian who should direct his charge in his
studies and counsel him in his personal life and conduct. For this
very important position Kingo wisely chose one of the most distinguished
and respected teachers at the university, Prof. Bartholin,
a brother of his former rector. Professor Bartholin was not
only a learned man, known for his years of travel and study in
foreign parts, but he was also a man of rare personal gifts and sincere
piety. In his younger days he had spent four years at the
castle of Rosenholm where the godly and scholarly nobleman,
Holger Rosenkrans, then gathered groups of young nobles about
him for study and meditation. Rosenkrans was a close friend of
John Arndt, a leader in the early Pietist movement in Germany,
to which the young Bartholin under his influence became deeply
attached. Nor had this attachment lessened with the years. And
Bartholin&rsquo;s influence upon Kingo was so strong that the latter,
when entering upon his own work, lost no time in showing his
adherence to the Arndt-Rosenkrans view of Christianity.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he applied himself diligently to his work at the
university. Like other disciplines the study of theology at that
time was affected by a considerable portion of dry-rust. Orthodoxy
ruled the cathedra. With that as a weapon, the student must
be trained to meet all the wiles of the devil and perversions of the
heretics. Its greatest Danish exponent, Jesper Brochman, had
just passed to his reward, but his monumental work, <b>The System
of Danish Theology</b>, remained after him, and continued to serve
as an authoritative textbook for many years to come. Though dry
and devoted to hairsplitting as orthodoxy no doubt was, it probably
was not quite as lifeless as later generations represent it to have
been. Kingo is often named &ldquo;The Singer of Orthodoxy&rdquo;, yet no
one can read his soul-stirring hymns with their profound sense of
sin and grace without feeling that he, at least, possessed a deeper
knowledge of Christianity than a mere dogmatic training could
give him.</p>
<p>Kingo&rsquo;s last months at the university were disturbed by a new
war with Sweden that for a while threatened the independent existence
<span class="pb" id="pg_27">[27]</span>
of the country, a threat which was averted only by the
ceding of some of its finest provinces. During these stirring events,
Kingo had to prepare for his final examinations which he passed
with highest honors in the spring of 1658.</p>
<p>Thus with considerable deprivation and sacrifice, the humble
weaver&rsquo;s son had attained his membership in the academic world,
an unusual accomplishment for a man of his standing in those days.
His good parents had reason to be proud of their promising and
well educated son who now, after his many years of study, returned
to the parental home. His stay there was short, however,
for he obtained almost immediate employment as a private tutor,
first with the family of J&oslash;rgen S&oslash;rensen, the overseer at Frederiksborg
castle, and later, with the Baroness Lena Rud of Vedby
Manor, a position which to an impecunious but ambitious young
man like Kingo must have appeared especially desirable. Lena
Rud belonged to what at that time was one of the wealthiest and
most influential families in the country. Many of her relatives
occupied neighboring estates, a circumstance which enabled Kingo
to become personally acquainted with a number of them; and with
one of them, the worthy Karsten Atke, he soon formed a close
and lasting friendship. He also appears to have made a very favorable
impression upon his influential patrons and, despite his subordinate
position, to have become something of a social leader, especially
among the younger members of the group.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the country once again had been plunged into a
desperate struggle. The Swedish king, Gustav X, soon repented
of the peace he had made when the whole country was apparently
at his mercy, and renewed the war in the hope of affixing the Danish
crown to his own. This hope vanished in the desperate battle
of Copenhagen in 1659, where the Swedish army suffered a decisive
defeat by the hand of an aroused citizenry. But detachments
of the defeated army still occupied large sections of the
country districts where they, like all armies of that day, robbed,
pillaged and murdered at will, driving thousands of people away
from their homes and forcing them to roam homeless and destitute
through the wasted countryside. Acts of robbery and violence
belonged to the order of the day. Even Kingo received a bullet
through his mouth in a fight with a Swedish dragoon, whom he
boldly attempted to stop from stealing one of his employer&rsquo;s horses.
When the country finally emerged from the conflict, her resources
were depleted, her trade destroyed, and large sections of her country
districts laid waste, losses which it required years for her to
<span class="pb" id="pg_28">[28]</span>
regain. But youth must be served. Despite the gravity and hardships
of the day, the young people from Vedby managed to have
their parties and other youthful diversions. And at these, Kingo
soon became a welcome and valued guest. His attractive personality,
sprightly humor and distinct social gifts caused his highly
placed friends to accept him with delight.</p>
<p>This popularity, if he had cared to exploit it, might have carried
him far. In those days the usual road to fame and fortune for
an obscure young man was to attach himself to some wealthy
patron and acquire a position through him. With the aid of his
wealthy friends Kingo could easily enough have obtained employment
as a companion to some young noble going abroad for travel
and study. It came, therefore, as a surprise to all when he accepted
a call as assistant to the Reverend Jacobsen Worm at Kirkehelsinge,
a country parish a few miles from Vedby. The position was
so far short of what a young man of Kingo&rsquo;s undoubted ability and
excellent connections might have obtained, that one may well ask
for his motive in accepting it. And although Kingo himself has
left no direct explanation of his action, the following verses, which
he is thought to have written about this time, may furnish a key.</p>
<div class="verse">

<p>It is understandable, at least, that a young man with such sentiments
should forego the prospect of worldly honor for a chance
to serve his Master.</p>
<p>Kingo was ordained in the Church of Our Lady at Copenhagen
in September, 1661, and was installed in his new office a few
weeks later. The seven years that he spent in the obscure parish
were, no doubt, among the most fruitful years of Kingo&rsquo;s life,
proving the truth of the old adage that it is better that a man
should confer honor on his position than that the position should
confer honor upon him. His fiery, forceful eloquence made him
<span class="pb" id="pg_29">[29]</span>
known as an exceptionally able and earnest pastor, and his literary
work established his fame as one of the foremost Danish poets of
his day.</p>
<p>While still at Vedby, Kingo had written a number of poems
which, widely circulated in manuscripts, had gained him a local
fame. But he now published a number of new works that attained
nation-wide recognition. These latter works compare well with
the best poetry of the period and contain passages that still may
be read with interest. The style is vigorous, the imagery striking
and at times beautiful, but the Danish language was too little cultivated
and contemporary taste too uncertain to sustain a work of
consistent excellence. Most successful of Kingo&rsquo;s early poems are
&ldquo;Karsten Atke&rsquo;s Farewell to Lion County&rdquo;, a truly felt and finely
expressed greeting to his friends, the Atkes, on their departure
from their former home, and &ldquo;Chrysillis&rdquo;, a lovesong, written in
a popular French style that was then very much admired in Denmark.
Both poems contain parts that are surprisingly fine, and
they attained an immense popularity. But although Kingo throughout
his life continued to write secular poetry that won him the
highest praise, that part of his work is now well nigh forgotten.
It is truly interesting to compare the faded beauty of his secular
poems with the perennial freshness of his hymns.</p>
<p>It was inevitable that Kingo, with his high ambitions and
undoubted ability should desire a larger field of labor. His salary
was so small that he had to live in the home of his employer, a
circumstance that for various reasons was not always pleasant.
Pastor Worm had married thrice and had a large family of children
of all ages from a babe in arms to a son at the university.
This son, Jacob Worm, was a brilliant but irascible and excessively
proud youth only a few years younger than Kingo. From
what we know about him in later years, it is likely that Kingo&rsquo;s
contact with him during his vacations at home must have proved
exceedingly trying. The bitter enmity that later existed between
the two men probably had its inception at this time. In 1666, Kingo,
therefore, applied for a waiting appointment to his home church
at Slangerup, where the pastor was growing old and, in the course
of nature, could be expected ere long to be called to his reward.
The application was granted, and when the pastor did die two
years later, Kingo at once was installed as his successor.</p>
<p>Slangerup was only a small city, but it had a new and very
beautiful church, which still stands almost unchanged. One may
still sit in the same pews and see the same elaborately carved
<span class="pb" id="pg_30">[30]</span>
pulpit and altar which graced its lofty chancel during the pastorate
of the great hymnwriter. A beautiful chandelier, which he donated
and inscribed, still adorns the arched nave. In this splendid
sanctuary it must have been inspiring to listen to the known eloquence
of its most famous pastor as he preached the gospel or,
with his fine musical voice, chanted the liturgy before the altar.
The church was always well attended when Kingo conducted
the service. People soon recognized his exceptional ability and
showed their appreciation of his devoted ministry. The position
of a pastor was then much more prominent than it is now. He was
the official head of numerous enterprises, both spiritual and civic,
and the social equal of the best people in the community. With
many people the custom of calling him &ldquo;Father&rdquo; was then by no
means an empty phrase. Parishioners sought their pastor and
accepted his counsel in numerous affairs that are now considered
to be outside of his domain. In view of Kingo&rsquo;s humble antecedents,
a position of such prominence might well have proved difficult
to maintain among a people that knew his former station. But
of such difficulties the record of his pastorate gives no indication.
He was, it appears, one exception to the rule that a prophet is not
respected in his own country.</p>
<p>When he moved to Slangerup, Kingo was still unmarried. But
about two years later he married the widow of his former superior,
Pastor Worm, becoming at once the head of a large family consisting
of the children of his wife and those of her first husband
by his previous marriage. It was a serious responsibility to assume,
both morally and financially. The parish was quite large,
but his income was considerably reduced by the payment of a
pension to the widow of the former pastor and the salary to an
assistant. With such a drain on his income and with a large family
to support, Kingo&rsquo;s economic circumstances must have been
strained. But he was happy with his wife and proved himself a
kind and conscientious stepfather to her children who, even after
their maturity, maintained a close relationship with him.</p>
<p>Kingo&rsquo;s happiness proved, however, to be but a brief interlude
to a period of intense sorrows and disappointments. His wife died
less than a year after their marriage; his father, whom he loved
and revered, passed away the same year; and the conduct of his
stepson, the formerly mentioned Jacob Worm, caused him bitter
trouble and humiliation. The bright prospect of this brilliant but
erratic youth had quickly faded. After a number of failures, he had
been forced to accept a position as rector of the small and insignificant
<span class="pb" id="pg_31">[31]</span>
Latin school at Slangerup, thus coming under the immediate
authority of Kingo, who, as pastor, supervised the educational
institutions of the parish. Worm always seems to have thought of
Kingo as a former assistant to his father, and his position as an
inferior to a former inferior in his own home, therefore, bitterly
wounded his pride. Seeking an outlet for his bitterness, he wrote
a number of extremely abusive poems about his stepfather and
circulated them among the people of the parish. This unwarranted
abuse aroused the anger of Kingo and provoked him to answer in
kind. The ensuing battle of vituperation and name-calling brought
no honor to either side. Worm&rsquo;s conduct toward his superior, the
man who was unselfishly caring for his minor sisters and brothers,
deserves nothing but condemnation; but it is painful, nevertheless,
to behold the great hymnwriter himself employing the abusive
language of his worthless opponent. The times were violent, however,
and Kingo possessed his share of their temper. Kingo&rsquo;s last
act in this drama between himself and his stepson throws a somewhat
softening light upon his conduct. Embittered by persistent
failures, Worm continued to pour out his bitterness not only upon
his stepfather, but upon other and much higher placed persons
until at last he was caught and sentenced to die on the gallows for
&ldquo;having written and circulated grossly defamatory poems about
the royal family&rdquo;. In this extremity, he appealed to Kingo, who
successfully exerted his then great influence to have the sentence
commuted to banishment for life to the Danish colony in India.</p>
</div>
<div id="c04" title="Kingo, the Hymnwriter">
<h4>Chapter Four
<span class="chaptertitle">Kingo, the Hymnwriter</span></h4>
<p>Kingo&rsquo;s first hymns appeared shortly before Christmas,
1673, in a small volume entitled <b>Spiritual Song-Choir, Part I</b>.
The book contained fifteen morning and evening hymns and
seven paraphrases of the psalms. Later editions were enlarged by
seven &ldquo;Morning and Evening Sighs&rdquo; short hymns that belong to
the very best in the collection.</p>
<p>In a foreword addressed to the king, Kingo states that &ldquo;he has
written these hymns with the hope that they might serve to edify
his fellow Christians, advance the teaching of the Gospel and benefit
<span class="pb" id="pg_32">[32]</span>
the royal household at those daily devotions which it is the duty
of every Christian home to practice&rdquo;. He prays, therefore, he continues,
that &ldquo;the king will graciously bestow the same approval
upon this work that he has so kindly given to his previous efforts,
and thereby encourage him to continue his endeavor until the
Danes shall possess a hymnody that they have neither begged nor
borrowed from other nations. For the Danish spirit,&rdquo; he concludes,
&ldquo;is assuredly neither so weak nor so poor that it cannot fly as
high toward heaven as that of other peoples without being borne
upon strange and foreign wings&rdquo;.</p>
<div class="img" title="Spiritual Song-Choir, Part I">
<img height="785" width="500" alt="Spiritual Song-Choir, Part I" src="images/songkoor.png" />
</div>
<p>Commenting on the content of the book, Kingo further explains
that he expects sensitive readers will discover imperfections in
his work which he himself has failed to see, and that it would
please him to have such blemishes called to his attention so that
they might be corrected in future issues. His choice of tunes will,
he fears, provoke criticism. He has set a number of hymns to the
melodies of popular songs in order that &ldquo;those, who for the sake
of its tune, now gladly listen to a song of Sodom may, if they be
Christians, with the more pleasure use it with a hymn about Zion.
<span class="pb" id="pg_33">[33]</span>
By examining the work of other hymnwriters possible critics might
assure themselves, however, that he had in this matter only followed
their example.&rdquo; But Kingo need not have apologized for his
choice of tunes, for they were on the whole fine and were received
without objection.</p>
<p>It would be difficult to overstate the enthusiasm with which
Kingo&rsquo;s hymns were received. Within a few years they were
printed in numerous editions and translated into several foreign
languages. Their enthusiastic reception was well deserved. Viewed
against the background of literary mediocrity that characterized
the period, Kingo&rsquo;s hymns stand out with amazing perfection.
Danish hymnody contained nothing that could compare with them,
and other countries, as far as morning and evening hymns were
concerned, were in the same position. Paul Gerhardt&rsquo;s fine hymn,
&ldquo;Now Rests Beneath Night&rsquo;s Shadow&rdquo;, which was written twenty
years earlier, had been ridiculed into disuse; Ken&rsquo;s famous morning
hymn dates from twenty years later; and none of these are as
fine as the best of Kingo&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>As might be expected, the hymns are not all of the same merit.
Some of them are exceedingly fine; others show the defects of
an imperfectly developed language and a deficient literary taste.
In the matter of style and form the author had almost nothing to
guide him. It is not surprising, therefore, that his work shows
crudities which no present day writer would commit, but that
it should contain so much that is truly beautiful, even when measured
by the standards of today.</p>
<p>Kingo had the true poet&rsquo;s ability to see things poetically. To
him the rays of the rising sun were not only shining but &ldquo;laughing
on the roof&rdquo; of his home. His imagery is rich and skillfully applied.
Many of his hymns abound in striking similes. Their outstanding
characteristic, however, is a distinctive, forceful realism. Kingo,
when he chose to do so, could touch the lyre with enhancing
gentleness, but he preferred the strong note and searched always
for the most graphic expression, sometimes too graphic, as when
he speaks of the &ldquo;frothing wrath of God&rdquo; and &ldquo;the oozy slime of
sin&rdquo;. Yet it is this trait of robust reality that invests his hymns
with a large part of their enduring merit. &ldquo;When Kingo sings of
God, one feels as though He were right there with him&rdquo;, one of his
commentators exclaims. Nor is that realism a mere literary pose.
Like most great hymns, his best hymns are reflections of his own
experiences. Kingo never attained a state of saintly serenity.
Whatever peace he found was gained only through a continuous
<span class="pb" id="pg_34">[34]</span>
struggle with his own fiery and passionate nature. Few hymns
convey a more vivid impression of a believing, struggling soul than
Kingo&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>His morning hymns are among his best. He loved light and
gloried in the birth of each new day. The sun is his favorite symbol.
Its rising signifies to him the final triumph of life over death,
and the new day is a token thereof. It sounds a joyful call to wake
and resume life anew.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Awake, my soul, the sun is risen,</p>
<p class="t0">Upon my roof its rays now laugh,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Every Christian should rejoice in the newborn day and thank
God for it:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Break now forth in Jesus&rsquo; name,</p>
<p class="t0">Blessed morn, in all thy splendor!</p>
<p class="t0">I will sweetest music render</p>
<p class="t0">And thy wondrous gifts proclaim.</p>
<p class="t0">All my spirit with rejoicing</p>
<p class="t0">Thanks the Lord for rest and care</p>
<p class="t0">And, His grace and goodness voicing,</p>
<p class="t0">Wings its way to Him in prayer.</p>
</div>
<p>But the commencing day also calls for consecration lest its hours
be wasted and its opportunities lost:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Grant me, Lord, that on this day</p>
<p class="t0">Now with light and grace beginning,</p>
<p class="t0">I shall not submit to sinning</p>
<p class="t0">Nor Thy word and way betray.</p>
<p class="t0">Blessed Jesus, hover ever</p>
<p class="t0">Over me, my Sun and Shield,</p>
<p class="t0">That I firm may stand and never</p>
<p class="t0">Unto sin and Satan yield.</p>
</div>
<p>And the passing hours must admonish the Christian to work
while it is day and to prepare for the evening that is coming:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Let each fleeting hour of grace</p>
<p class="t0">And the chiming bells remind me</p>
<p class="t0">That to earth I must not bind me</p>
<p class="t0">But Thy life and gifts embrace.</p>
<p class="t0">And when dawns my final morrow,</p>
<p class="t0">Let me go to Thee for aye,</p>
<p class="t0">Let my sin and care and sorrow</p>
<p class="t0">With my dust be put away.</p>
</div>
<p>Finest of all Kingo&rsquo;s morning hymns is the splendid &ldquo;The Sun
Arises Now in Light and Glory&rdquo;. This hymn presents all the finest
<span class="pb" id="pg_35">[35]</span>
traits of Kingo&rsquo;s poetry, its vivid imagery, forceful style and robust
faith. The following translation is by the Rev. P. C. Paulsen.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The sun arises now</p>
<p class="t0">In light and glory</p>
<p class="t0">And gilds the rugged brow</p>
<p class="t0">Of mountains hoary.</p>
<p class="t0">Rejoice, my soul, and lift</p>
<p class="t0">Thy voice in singing</p>
<p class="t0">To God from earth below,</p>
<p class="t0">Thy song with joy aglow</p>
<p class="t0">And praises ringing.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">As countless as the sand</p>
<p class="t0">And beyond measure,</p>
<p class="t0">As wide as sea and land</p>
<p class="t0">So is the treasure</p>
<p class="t0">Of grace which God each day</p>
<p class="t0">Anew bestoweth</p>
<p class="t0">And which, like pouring rain,</p>
<p class="t0">Into my soul again</p>
<p class="t0">Each morning floweth.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Preserve my soul today</p>
<p class="t0">From sin and blindness;</p>
<p class="t0">Surround me on my way</p>
<p class="t0">With loving kindness.</p>
<p class="t0">Embue my heart, O Lord,</p>
<p class="t0">With joy from heaven;</p>
<p class="t0">I then shall ask no more</p>
<p class="t0">Than what Thou hast of yore</p>

</div>
<p>Evening naturally inspires a different sentiment than morning.
The rising sun calls for activity, the setting sun for reflection. As
the sun sets, as work ceases and the busy day merges into the
quiet night the soul begins to take account of its gains and losses,
its assets and liabilities. The dying day also conveys a sense of
insecurity, of approaching death and the need for pardon and protection.
All these sentiments, so different from the hopes and
<span class="pb" id="pg_36">[36]</span>
prospects of the morning, are wonderfully portrayed in Kingo&rsquo;s
evening hymns, as for instance:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Vanish now all sinful dreaming,</p>
<p class="t0">Let the joy from heaven streaming</p>
<p class="t0">Occupy my soul and mind.</p>
<p class="t0">Watch, my spirit, and prepare thee,</p>
<p class="t0">Lest the cunning foe ensnare thee</p>
<p class="t0">When repose hath made thee blind.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Sleep now in God&rsquo;s care appeasing.</p>
<p class="t0">While the noise of day is ceasing,</p>
<p class="t0">Lean upon thy Savior&rsquo;s breast.</p>
<p class="t0">He will guard thee through the somber</p>
<p class="t0">Night and make thy final slumber</p>
<p class="t0">Quiet, peaceful, happy, blest.</p>
</div>
<p>In the last line with its crescendo of peace and happiness one
almost sees the night merge into the final rest.</p>
<p>Among his evening hymns now available in English, the following,
perhaps, is the best known.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Softly now the day is ending,</p>
<p class="t0">Night o&rsquo;er hill and vale descending,</p>
<p class="t0">I will kneel before Thee, Lord.</p>
<p class="t0">Unto Thee my thanks I render</p>
<p class="t0">That Thou didst in mercy tender</p>
<p class="t0">Life and peace to me accord.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">May Thy church Thy peace inherit,</p>
<p class="t0">Guide our leaders by Thy spirit,</p>
<p class="t0">Grant our country strength and peace.</p>
<p class="t0">To the straying, sad and dreary,</p>
<p class="t0">To each Christian faint or weary</p>
<p class="t0">Grant Thou solace and surcease.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Keep me, Jesus, while I slumber!</p>
<p class="t0">From my perils without number,</p>
<p class="t0">Shield me, Master, in Thy might,</p>
<p class="t0">That, released from sin and sorrow,</p>
<p class="t0">I may sing this song tomorrow:</p>
<p class="t0">Jesus was my Sun this night.</p>
</div>
<p>The publication of these hymns firmly established Kingo&rsquo;s reputation
as the foremost poet of his country. Expressions of appreciation
poured in upon him from high and low. The king, to whom
the hymns were dedicated, so greatly appreciated the gift that,
only three years later, he called their otherwise obscure author to
become bishop of Fyn, one of the largest and most important
dioceses of the country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_37">[37]</div>
<p>Kingo was only forty-two years old when he assumed his new
position. His quick elevation from an obscure parish to one of the
highest offices within the church might well have strained the
abilities of an older and more experienced man. But there can be
no doubt that he filled his high position with signal ability. He was
both able and earnest, both practical and spiritual. His diocese
prospered under his care and his work as a bishop, aside from his
renown as a poet, was outstanding enough to give him an enviable
reputation in his own generation.</p>
<p>But since his permanent fame and importance rest upon his
achievement as a hymnwriter, his appointment as bishop probably
must be counted as a loss, both to himself and to the church. His
new responsibilities and the multifarious duties of his high office
naturally left him less time for other pursuits. He traveled, visited
and preached almost continuously throughout his large charge,
and it appears like a miracle that under these circumstances, he
still found time to write hymns. But in 1684, only two years after
his consecration as bishop, he published the second part of <b>Spiritual
Song-Choir</b>.</p>
<p>This book bears a dedication to the queen, Charlotte Amalia.
She was German by birth and a pious, able and distinguished
woman in her own right. Kingo praises her especially for her
effort to learn and speak the Danish language. In this respect, he
declares, &ldquo;Her Majesty put many to shame who have eaten the
king&rsquo;s bread for thirty years without learning to speak thirty words
of Danish, because they hold it to be a homespun language, too
coarse for their silky tongues&rdquo;.</p>
<p><b>Spiritual Song-Choir, Part II</b> contains twenty hymns and seventeen
&ldquo;sighs&rdquo;, thus outwardly following the arrangement of Part I.
But the content is very different. The hymns are songs of penitence,
repentance and faith. They show mastery of form, a wealth
of imagery, a facility for concentrated expression and a range of
sentiment from stark despair to the most confident trust that is,
perhaps, unequalled in Danish poetry. It is an embattled soul that
speaks through these hymns, a soul that has faced the abyss and
clung heroically, but not always successfully, to the pinnacle of
faith. One feels that the man who penned the following lines has
not merely imagined the nearness of the pit but felt himself standing
on the very brink of it.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Mountains of transgressions press</p>
<p class="t0">On my evil burdened shoulders,</p>
<p class="t0">Guilt bestrews my path with boulders,</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_38">[38]</div>
<p class="t0">Sin pollutes both soul and flesh,</p>
<p class="t0">Law and justice are proclaiming</p>
<p class="t0">Judgment on my guilty head,</p>
<p class="t0">Hell&rsquo;s eternal fires are flaming,</p>
<p class="t0">Filling all my soul with dread.</p>
</div>
<p>Of an even darker mood is the great hymn: &ldquo;Sorrow and Unhappiness&rdquo;,
with the searching verse:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Is there then no one that cares,</p>
<p class="t0">Is there no redress for sorrow,</p>
<p class="t0">Is there no relief to borrow,</p>
<p class="t0">Is there no response to prayers,</p>
<p class="t0">Is the fount of mercy closing,</p>
<p class="t0">Is the soul to bondage sold,</p>
<p class="t0">Is the Lord my plea opposing,</p>
<p class="t0">Is His heart to sinners cold?</p>
</div>
<p>The poet answers his questions in the following stanzas by
assuring himself that the Sun of God&rsquo;s grace can and will pierce
even his &ldquo;cloud of despair&rdquo;, and that he must wait therefore in
quietness and trust:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O my soul, be quiet then!</p>
<p class="t0">Jesus will redress thy sadness,</p>
<p class="t0">Jesus will restore thy gladness,</p>
<p class="t0">Jesus will thy help remain.</p>
<p class="t0">Jesus is thy solace ever</p>
<p class="t0">And thy hope in life and death;</p>
<p class="t0">Jesus will thee soon deliver;</p>
<p class="t0">Thou must cling to that blest faith.</p>
</div>
<p>The uncertainty of life and its fortunes furnished a favored
theme for many of his hymns, as for instance in the splendid&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Sorrow and gladness oft journey together,</p>
<p class="t0">Trouble and happiness swift company keep;</p>
<p class="t0">Luck and misfortune change like the weather;</p>
<p class="t0">Sunshine and clouds quickly vary their sweep.</p>
</div>
<p>which is, poetically at least, one of his finest compositions. The
poet&rsquo;s own career so far had been one of continuous and rather
swift advancement. But there was, if not in his own outward fortune,
then in the fortunes of other notables of his day, enough to
remind him of the inconstancy of worldly honor and glory. Only
a few months before the publication of his hymns, Leonora Christine
Ulfeldt, the once beautiful, admired and talented daughter
<span class="pb" id="pg_39">[39]</span>
of Christian IV, had been released from twenty-two years of imprisonment
in a bare and almost lightless prison-cell; Peder Griffenfeldt,
a man who from humble antecedents swiftly had risen to
become the most powerful man in the kingdom, had been stript
even more swiftly of all his honors and thrown into a dismal
prison on a rocky isle by the coast of Norway; and there were
other and well known instances of swift changes in the fortunes
of men in those days when they were subject not only to the
ordinary vicissitudes of human existence but to the fickle humor
of an absolute monarch. It is, therefore, as though Kingo at the
height of his own fortune would remind himself of the quickness
with which it might vanish, of the evanescense and vanity of all
worldly glory. That idea is strikingly emphasized in the following
famous hymn:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">Vain world, fare thee well!</p>
<p class="t0">I purpose no more in thy bondage to dwell;</p>
<p class="t0">The burdens which thou hast enticed me to bear,</p>
<p class="t0">I cast now aside with their troubles and care.</p>
<p class="t0">I spurn thy allurements, which tempt and appall;</p>
<p class="t">&rsquo;Tis vanity all!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">What merit and worth</p>
<p class="t0">Hath all that the world puts so temptingly forth!</p>
<p class="t0">It is naught but bubbles and tinctured glass,</p>
<p class="t0">Loud clamoring cymbals and shrill sounding brass.</p>
<p class="t0">What are their seductions which lure and enthrall;</p>
<p class="t">&rsquo;Tis vanity all!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">O honor and gold,</p>
<p class="t0">Vain idols which many with worship behold!</p>
<p class="t0">False are your affluence, your pleasure and fame;</p>
<p class="t0">Your wages are envy, deception and shame,</p>
<p class="t0">Your garlands soon wither, your kingdom shall fall;</p>
<p class="t">&rsquo;Tis vanity all!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">O carnal desire,</p>
<p class="t0">Thou tempting, consuming and treacherous fire,</p>
<p class="t0">That catches like tinder and scorches like flame,</p>
<p class="t0">Consigning the victim to sorrow and shame,</p>
<p class="t0">Thy honeyest potion is wormwood and gall;</p>
<p class="t">&rsquo;Tis vanity all!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">Then, fare thee farewell,</p>
<p class="t0">Vain world, with thy tempting and glamorous spell!</p>
<p class="t0">Thy wiles shall no longer my spirit enslave,</p>
<p class="t0">Thy splendor and joy are designed for the grave</p>
<p class="t0">I yearn for the solace from sorrows and harm</p>
<p class="t">Of Abraham&rsquo;s arm!</p>

<p class="t">There shall all my years</p>

<p>This is an eloquent farewell, clothed in all the expressive wealth
of language and imagery of which Kingo was such a master. One
cannot repress the feeling, however, that it presents a challenge
rather than a farewell. A man that so passionately avows his
repudiation of the world must have felt its attraction, its power to
tempt and enthrall. He fights against it; the spirit contends with
the flesh, but the fight is not easy. And it is in part this very
human trait in Kingo that endears his song to us. What Christian
does not recognize some of his own experiences in the following
characteristic song:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Ever trouble walks beside me,<sup><a id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p class="t0">Ever God with grace provides me,</p>
<p class="t0">Ever have I fear and grief,</p>
<p class="t0">Ever Jesus brings relief.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Ever sin my heart accuses,</p>
<p class="t0">Ever Jesus help induces,</p>
<p class="t0">Ever am I weighed with care,</p>
<p class="t0">Ever full of praise and prayer.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">So is joy by grief attended,</p>
<p class="t0">Fortune with misfortune blended;</p>
<p class="t0">Blessings mixed with grief and strife</p>
<p class="t0">Is the measure of my life.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But, O Jesus, I am crying:</p>
<p class="t0">Help that faith, on Thee relying,</p>
<p class="t0">Over sin and grief alway</p>
<p class="t0">Shall prevail and gain the day.</p>
</div>
<p>Some statements in this hymn have frequently been criticized
as contradictory, for how can one be &ldquo;always&rdquo; full of care and
&ldquo;always&rdquo; full of praise and prayer? The terms cancel each other.
But are not such contradictions expressive of life itself? Few&mdash;if
any&mdash;are wholly one thing or wholly another. People are complex.
Their joys struggle with their sorrows, their most earnest
faith with their doubts and fears. It brings Kingo nearer to us to
know that he shared that struggle. His songs have appealed to
<span class="pb" id="pg_41">[41]</span>
millions because they are both so spiritual and so human. How
expressive of human need and Christian trust are not the following
brief lines:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lord, though I may</p>
<p class="t0">The whole long day</p>
<p class="t0">Find no relief from sorrow,</p>
<p class="t0">Yea, should the night</p>
<p class="t0">Afford no light</p>
<p class="t0">To ease my plight&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Thou comest on the morrow.</p>

<h4>Chapter Five
<span class="chaptertitle">Kingo&rsquo;s Psalmbook</span></h4>
<p>After the publication of <b>Spiritual Song-Choir II</b>, Kingo stood
at the very height of his fame. His hymns were sung everywhere,
and nobles and commoners vied with each other in
chanting his praises. But a much more difficult task now awaited
him&mdash;that of preparing a new hymnal.</p>
<p>Hans Thomisson&rsquo;s hymnal had become antiquated after serving
the church for nearly one hundred and twenty-five years. It had
served its purpose well. Its hymns had been sung by high and low
until they had entered into the thoughts and conscience of all. A
changing language and a fast developing literary taste long ago
had shown their need for revision; but the people so far had opposed
all attempts to change their beloved old songs. Their defects
by now had become so conspicuous, however, that even the more
conservative admitted the desirability of at least a limited revision.
And the only man for the undertaking of such a task was, of course,
Kingo.</p>
<p>In March, 1683, King Christian V, therefore, commissioned
Thomas Kingo to prepare and publish a new church hymnal for
the kingdom of Denmark and Norway. The carefully prepared instructions
of his commission directed him to eliminate undesirable
hymns; to revise antiquated rhymes and expressions; to adopt at
least two new hymns by himself or another for every pericope and
epistle of the church year, but under no circumstances to make any
changes in Luther&rsquo;s hymns that would alter their meaning.</p>
<p>Kingo would undoubtedly have saved himself a great deal of
<span class="pb" id="pg_42">[42]</span>
disappointment if he had conscientiously followed his instructions.
But the draft of the first half of the hymnal, which was sent to the
king six years later, showed that, intentionally or otherwise, he had
ignored them almost completely. The draft contained 267 hymns of
which 137 were his own and the remainder those of various authors,
both old and new. Though Kingo might reasonably have been criticized
for adopting such a proportionally large number of his own
compositions, it was not, however, his selection of new hymns but
his treatment of the old hymns that provoked the greatest opposition.
For he had not contented himself with merely revising the
latter but in many instances had rewritten them so completely that
they were unrecognizable. And it mattered not that the new texts
were on the whole much finer than the old, for people were not
yet ready to relinquish these. The opposition grew so strong that
the king, though he had already approved the proposed hymnal,
a few weeks later revoked not only his approval but Kingo&rsquo;s commission.</p>
<p>This summary action came as an almost stunning blow to Kingo,
affecting seriously both his pride and his finances. On the
strength of the king&rsquo;s approval, he had already bought a printing
press, acquired large quantities of material and printed a large edition
of the book. And these investments, which represented a large
part of his private fortune, were now apparently lost. It helped but
little that the king, in order to salve the wound he had inflicted
upon one of his most distinguished subjects, elevated him to the
nobility, for the hurt was too deep to be healed by a mere gesture.</p>
<p>One cannot deny, however, that the monarch had serious reason
for his action. Not only had Kingo violated his instructions
but he had planned a book that hardly could have proved satisfactory.
It would have been both too large and too expensive for
common use. He himself, on the other hand, had reason to complain
that he had not been consulted before the work, on which he
had spent so much of his time and substance, was summarily rejected.
No doubt the king had acted with unseemly haste and lack
of consideration.</p>
<p>The work was now held in abeyance for a few years. But the
need for a new hymnal was too pressing to be permanently ignored.
The king, therefore, appointed S&oslash;ren Jonasson, a provost at the
cathedral of Roskilde, to undertake the work. Jonasson was known
as an excellent translator of German hymns, and the choice appeared
reasonable. He worked fast and in less than two years was
able to present a draft of his work. This contained a well balanced
<span class="pb" id="pg_43">[43]</span>
selection of the old hymns and about twenty new hymns by
himself and various German authors, but not a single hymn by
Kingo. The omission no doubt reflects the envy that the poet&rsquo;s
quick rise to fame had stirred up against him in certain influential
circles. His enemies, however, had overshot their mark. Even the
king realized that it would be impossible at this time to publish a
hymnal that ignored the work of the country&rsquo;s greatest hymnwriter.
And so Jonasson&rsquo;s work promptly shared the fate of his predecessor&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The troublesome problem now rested again for a few years until
it was revived by the zealous efforts of the king&rsquo;s chaplain, Peter
Jespersen, a close friend of the Norwegian hymnwriter, Peter
Dass and himself a native of the northern country.</p>
<p>A committee was appointed to prepare and publish a new
hymnal &ldquo;that should give due recognition&rdquo; to the work of Kingo.
Although it was not specifically directed to do so, the committee
proved its good will toward the harshly treated poet by entering
into correspondence with him and asking him to forward the material
he already possessed, and to write the additional hymns that
might be needed to complete the hymnal. With this request Kingo
gladly complied, hoping that thus after all the greater part of
his work would be put to use. In this, however, he was disappointed.
When the hymnal finally appeared it contained 297 hymns of
which only 85 were by Kingo. This represented, it is true, a great
change from Jonasson&rsquo;s proposal, but when it is remembered that
the first half of the work, proposed by himself, contained 136 of his
own hymns, and that he had written an additional number by the
request of the committee, it will be seen that even now less than
half of his hymns found a place in the hymnal.</p>
<p>Aside from this deplorable loss, it must be conceded that the
committee had done an excellent work and that its hymnal was
much better suited for general use than Kingo&rsquo;s proposed hymnal
would have been. The committee also had shown its fairness toward
Kingo by commissioning him to print the hymnal and to enjoy exclusive
rights of its distribution for ten years, so that he might recoup
some of the losses he had sustained by the rejection of his own
book. He repaid the favor by turning out a most excellent piece of
work; and the book, both in content and appearance undoubtedly
rated as the finest hymnal the Danish church had so far produced.
It served the church for more than a hundred years, and was always
known as &ldquo;Kingo&rsquo;s Hymnal&rdquo;, for, after all, his great hymns were
what gave it permanent value.</p>

<h4>Chapter Six
<span class="chaptertitle">Kingo&rsquo;s Church Hymns</span></h4>
<p>Kingo&rsquo;s church hymns naturally differ from his spiritual
songs. They are more objective in form and less fiery in
spirit. Most of them follow their themes quite closely, reproducing
in many instances even the words of their text. Kingo
is too vital, however, to confine himself wholly to an objective
presentation. Usually the last stanzas of his hymns are devoted to
a brief and often striking application of their text. He possessed
to a singular degree the ability to express a thought tersely, as for
instance in the following stanza, the last of a hymn on the baptism
of the Lord:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Our Lord is then our brother</p>
<p class="t0">In whom we may confide,</p>
<p class="t0">The Church of God our mother,</p>
<p class="t0">The Holy Ghost our guide;</p>
<p class="t0">Our blest baptismal dower</p>
<p class="t0">The bands of hell has riven</p>
<p class="t0">And opened us God&rsquo;s heaven,</p>
<p class="t0">This is our faith each hour.</p>
</div>
<p>The hymns may be classed under four headings: Festival
Hymns, Sacramental Hymns, Historical Hymns and Hymns on the
Gospels and Epistles.</p>
<p>With the exception of his Easter anthem, his festival hymns
cannot compare with those of later authors. Some of his Pentecost
hymns, such as the hymns given below, are, however, still favorites.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The day of Pentecost draws nigh;</p>
<p class="t0">Come, Holy Spirit from on high,</p>
<p class="t0">Who with the Father and the Son</p>
<p class="t0">Is God eternal, three in one.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O God triune, Thy grace impart</p>
<p class="t0">Into my carnal, sinful heart,</p>
<p class="t0">That it a temple blest may be</p>
<p class="t0">Prepared and set aside for Thee.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come, Holy Ghost, and witness bear</p>
<p class="t0">That I the life of Christ do share,</p>
<p class="t0">And that I know no other name</p>
<p class="t0">To save my soul from guilt and shame.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_45">[45]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Counselor of truth and light,</p>
<p class="t0">Teach me to know my Lord aright,</p>
<p class="t0">That from the way of faith I may</p>
<p class="t0">Not even for a moment stray.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Blest Spirit of my God and Lord,</p>
<p class="t0">Preserve me in Thy way and word,</p>
<p class="t0">Imbue me with Thy life and breath,</p>
<p class="t0">Console me in the hour of death.</p>
</div>
<p>Kingo frequently is referred to as &ldquo;the Easter Singer of Denmark&rdquo;.
His claim to this title rests mainly on one song. Easter with
its story of triumphant victory appealed especially to him; and
he wrote several excellent hymns on the theme, but they are all
overshadowed by the splendid anthem presented below.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Like the golden sun ascending</p>
<p class="t0">In the darkly clouded sky</p>
<p class="t0">And on earth its glory spending</p>
<p class="t0">Until clouds and darkness fly,</p>
<p class="t0">So my Jesus from the grave,</p>
<p class="t0">From death&rsquo;s dark, abysmal cave,</p>
<p class="t0">Rose triumphant Easter morning,</p>
<p class="t0">Brighter than the sun returning.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thanks, O thanks, to Thee arisen</p>
<p class="t0">Lord and God Immanuel,</p>
<p class="t0">That the foe could not imprison</p>
<p class="t0">Thee within his hell-dark cell.</p>
<p class="t0">Thanks that Thou didst meet our foe</p>
<p class="t0">And his kingdom overthrow.</p>
<p class="t0">Jubilant my spirit raises</p>
<p class="t0">New Thy never ending praises.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Sin and death and every arrow</p>
<p class="t0">Satan hence may point at me</p>
<p class="t0">Fall now broken at the narrow</p>
<p class="t0">Tomb that saw Thy victory;</p>
<p class="t0">There Thou didst them all destroy</p>
<p class="t0">Giving me the cup of joy</p>
<p class="t0">That Thou glorious resurrection</p>
<p class="t0">Wrought my pardon and protection.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thou wilt hence to life awake me</p>
<p class="t0">By Thy resurrection power;</p>
<p class="t0">Death may wound and overtake me,</p>
<p class="t0">Worms my flesh and bones devour,</p>
<p class="t0">But I face the threat of death</p>
<p class="t0">With the sure and joyful faith</p>
<p class="t0">That its fearful reign was ended</p>
<p class="t0">When Thy might its portal rended.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_46">[46]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Blessed Jesus, let the Spirit</p>
<p class="t0">So imbue my heart with grace</p>
<p class="t0">That I walk by Thy blest merit</p>
<p class="t0">And no more the way retrace</p>
<p class="t0">To the vile and miry pit</p>
<p class="t0">Where I lay condemned, unfit,</p>
<p class="t0">Till redeemed to life victorious</p>
<p class="t0">By Thy resurrection glorious.</p>
</div>
<p>In this rugged hymn Kingo is at his best&mdash;fiery, vital, a master
of imagery and graphic expression.</p>
<p>His hymns on the sacraments faithfully reflect the doctrines
of the Lutheran Church. Here he most clearly shows his ability
to present objective truths in a devotional spirit. We meet in these
a Christian who humbly and prayerfully accepts the whole mystery
of God. For centuries these rugged songs have served to express
the sentiments of millions as they met at the baptismal font or
knelt before the altar. The following is one of the most favored
baptismal hymns both in the Danish and Norwegian churches:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Whoso believes and is baptized<sup><a id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p class="t0">God&rsquo;s kingdom shall inherit,</p>
<p class="t0">For he is cleansed by Jesus Christ</p>
<p class="t0">Who, by His grace and merit,</p>
<p class="t0">Adopts him as His child and heir,</p>
<p class="t0">Grants him in heaven&rsquo;s bliss to share</p>
<p class="t0">And seals him with His Spirit.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">We ask with earnest faith of Thee,</p>
<p class="t0">Our Lord and blest Defender,</p>
<p class="t0">That Thou wilt guide us constantly</p>
<p class="t0">And, in Thy mercy tender,</p>
<p class="t0">Keep us in our baptismal grace</p>
<p class="t0">Until at last we take our place</p>
<p class="t0">With Thee &rsquo;midst heaven&rsquo;s splendor.</p>
</div>
<p>Kingo&rsquo;s communion hymns have to a large extent been superseded
by later hymns of Grundtvig and others. But some of them
are still in common use. The following characteristic hymn is
frequently used before the communion.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lord Jesus Christ receive me now</p>
<p class="t0">As with a heart contrite I bow</p>
<p class="t0">Before Thine altar, blessed Lamb,</p>
<p class="t0">Who bore my sorrow, sin and shame.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I am today my Saviour&rsquo;s guest.</p>
<p class="t0">Bethink, my soul, the honor blest,</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_47">[47]</div>
<p class="t0">That He, Thy Lord, will sup with thee</p>
<p class="t0">And will Himself Thy nurture be.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He offers to thee with the bread</p>
<p class="t0">His body riven for thy aid,</p>
<p class="t0">And with the wine His precious blood,</p>
<p class="t0">The price of thy eternal good.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">How this can be, I cannot tell;</p>
<p class="t0">He did not on the mystery dwell;</p>
<p class="t0">No mind the secret can perceive,</p>
<p class="t0">It is enough that I believe.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Rejoice, then, O my soul today</p>
<p class="t0">That God&rsquo;s appointed servant may</p>
<p class="t0">Now offer thee the gift so free</p>
<p class="t0">Through which thy Lord unites with thee.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Lord, I offer Thee my soul</p>
<p class="t0">To nourish, strengthen and make whole.</p>
<p class="t0">Uphold me by Thy means of grace</p>
<p class="t0">Until I see Thee face to face.</p>
</div>
<p>The short hymn given below is a favorite after the communion
in numerous Danish and Norwegian churches.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O dearest Lord, receive from me</p>
<p class="t0">The heartfelt thanks I offer Thee,</p>
<p class="t0">Who through Thy body and Thy blood</p>
<p class="t0">Hast wrought my soul&rsquo;s eternal good.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Break forth, my soul, in joy and praise;</p>
<p class="t0">What wealth is mine this day of days!</p>
<p class="t0">My Jesus dwells within my soul;</p>
<p class="t0">Let every tongue His grace extol.</p>
</div>
<p>Kingo&rsquo;s historical hymns, that is, his hymns on the stories of
the Gospels, usually are not counted among the best. Yet there are
many fine hymns among them, such as the annunciation hymn,
&ldquo;There Came a Message from the Sky&rdquo;; the hymn about the wedding
at Cana, &ldquo;How Blessed Was that Wedding Feast&rdquo;; and the
splendid hymn on the transfiguration of the Lord, &ldquo;I Lift My Eyes
and Spirit Up unto the Hallowed Mountain Top Where Jesus Once
Ascended&rdquo;. Best known among this group of hymns is, however,
his great sequence of songs on our Lord&rsquo;s passion. In these inspired
hymns we meet again the Kingo that we know from his spiritual
songs, fiery, eloquent, imaginative, seeking to picture every detail
and mood of the Savior&rsquo;s suffering from the garden to the cross.
Though it is difficult to choose among hymns so universally fine,
the one given below is, at least, fairly representative of the group.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_48">[48]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Over Kedron Jesus passes</p>
<p class="t0">Ready for His passion day,</p>
<p class="t0">While the Prince of Darkness masses</p>
<p class="t0">All his legions for the fray.</p>
<p class="t0">Wily foes with evil hearts</p>
<p class="t0">Bend their bows and point their darts,</p>
<p class="t0">Aiming at the Savior solely,</p>
<p class="t0">As the world forsakes Him wholly.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">David once in great affliction</p>
<p class="t0">Crossed the Kedron&rsquo;s narrow stream,</p>
<p class="t0">While his foes without restriction</p>
<p class="t0">Hatched their vile and cunning scheme.</p>
<p class="t0">Darker far the shadows now</p>
<p class="t0">Bend about the Savior&rsquo;s brow</p>
<p class="t0">As He hastens to His passion</p>
<p class="t0">For the sinful world&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">See Him, torn by woe appalling,</p>
<p class="t0">Kneeling in the garden still,</p>
<p class="t0">And upon His Father calling</p>
<p class="t0">That, if possible, He will</p>
<p class="t0">Take the bitter cup away.</p>
<p class="t0">But how meekly He doth pray!</p>
<p class="t0">What the Father shall Him offer,</p>
<p class="t0">He obediently will suffer.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">See, what agony assails Him</p>
<p class="t0">In that dark and fearful hour;</p>
<p class="t0">Every friend deserts or fails Him;</p>
<p class="t0">Satan strikes with all his power;</p>
<p class="t0">And the flowers beneath Him grow</p>
<p class="t0">Crimson with the purple flow</p>
<p class="t0">From His anguished frame distilling</p>
<p class="t0">As His cup of woe is filling.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But, O flower, whose tender blossom</p>
<p class="t0">Caught that precious, purple dew</p>
<p class="t0">From the Saviour&rsquo;s riven bosom,</p>
<p class="t0">In a blessed hour you grew!</p>
<p class="t0">Eden&rsquo;s flowers did not bear</p>
<p class="t0">Fruits that could with yours compare:</p>
<p class="t0">By the blood your petals staining,</p>
<p class="t0">I am now salvation gaining.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When I like the flower must wither,</p>
<p class="t0">When I wilt and fade like grass,</p>
<p class="t0">When the hour of death draws hither,</p>
<p class="t0">When I from this world shall pass,</p>
<p class="t0">When my heart has ceased to beat</p>
<p class="t0">When I face God&rsquo;s judgment seat,</p>
<p class="t0">Then His blood, which stained the garden,</p>
<p class="t0">Shall procure my lasting pardon.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_49">[49]</div>
<p>Kingo&rsquo;s hymns on the pericopes have proved less resistant to
time than most of his other work. They are in reality brief commentaries,
presenting a practical rather than a poetical exposition
and application of their texts. But even so, the singular freshness
of their thought and style has preserved many of them until our day.
The following hymn on Matthew 8, 23-27, the stilling of the storm,
furnishes a characteristic example of this group of hymns.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">What vessel is that passing</p>
<p class="t0">Across the boundless deep,</p>
<p class="t0">On which the billows massing</p>
<p class="t0">In foaming fury sweep?</p>
<p class="t0">She seems in sore distress</p>
<p class="t0">As though she soon would founder</p>
<p class="t0">Upon the shoals around her</p>
<p class="t0">And sink without redress.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">It is the storm-tossed vessel</p>
<p class="t0">Of God&rsquo;s own church on earth,</p>
<p class="t0">With which the world doth wrestle,</p>
<p class="t0">And send its fury forth,</p>
<p class="t0">While Jesus oft appears</p>
<p class="t0">As though He still were sleeping,</p>
<p class="t0">With His disciples weeping</p>
<p class="t0">And crying out in fears.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But let the world with fury</p>
<p class="t0">Against the church but rave,</p>
<p class="t0">And spend its might to bury</p>
<p class="t0">Her in the roaring wave!</p>
<p class="t0">It only takes a word</p>
<p class="t0">To hush the wild commotion</p>
<p class="t0">And show the mighty ocean</p>
<p class="t0">Her Lord is still aboard.</p>
</div>
<p>Kingo is often called the singer of orthodoxy. His hymns faithfully
present the accepted doctrines of his church. No hymnwriter
is more staunchly Lutheran than he. But he was too vital to become
a mere doctrinaire. With him orthodoxy was only a means
to an end, a more vigorous Christian life. Many of his hymns present
a forceful and straightforward appeal for a real personal life
with God. The following hymn may be called an orthodox revival
hymn. It was a favorite with the great Norwegian lay preacher,
Hans Nielsen Hauge.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The power of sin no longer</p>
<p class="t0">Within my heart shall reign;</p>
<p class="t0">Faith must grow ever stronger</p>
<p class="t0">And carnal lust be slain;</p>
<p class="t0">For when I was baptized,</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_50">[50]</div>

<p class="t0">And I by grace delivered</p>
<p class="t0">To live for Jesus Christ.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Would I accept the merit</p>
<p class="t0">Of my baptismal grace</p>
<p class="t0">And with my faith and spirit</p>
<p class="t0">The Savior&rsquo;s cross embrace,</p>
<p class="t0">How great would be my blame</p>
<p class="t0">Should I abide in evil</p>
<p class="t0">And not renounce the devil</p>
<p class="t0">In Christ my Savior&rsquo;s name.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">It can bestow no treasure</p>
<p class="t0">On me that Christ arose.</p>
<p class="t0">If I will not with pleasure</p>

<p class="t0">And with my heart embrace</p>
<p class="t0">The Savior, who is risen</p>
<p class="t0">And has from error&rsquo;s prison</p>
<p class="t0">Redeemed me by His grace.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lord Jesus, help me ever</p>
<p class="t0">To fight &ldquo;the old man&rdquo; so</p>
<p class="t0">That he shall not deliver</p>
<p class="t0">Me to eternal woe,</p>
<p class="t0">But that I here may die</p>
<p class="t0">From sin and all offences</p>
<p class="t0">And, by the blood that cleanses,</p>
<p class="t0">Attain my home on high.</p>
</div>
<p>Thus, the permanent value of Kingo&rsquo;s hymns rests not only on
their rugged and expressive poetry but on the earnest and warm-hearted
Christian spirit that breathes through them. In the perennial
freshness of this spirit succeeding generations have experienced
their kinship with the poet and found expression for their
own hope and faith. The following ageless prayer expresses not
only the spirit of the poet but that of earnest Christians everywhere
and of every age.</p>
<div class="verse">

<div class="pb" id="pg_51">[51]</div>
<h4>Chapter Seven
<span class="chaptertitle">Kingo&rsquo;s Later Years</span></h4>
<p>Kingo&rsquo;s work with the hymnal had brought him much
disappointment and some loss of popularity. He felt not
without justification that he had been ill treated. He did not
sulk in his tent, however, but pursued his work with unabated zeal.
His diocese was large, comprising not only Fyn but a large number
of smaller islands besides. The work of making periodical visits to all
parishes within such a far-flung charge was, considering the then
available means of transportation, not only strenuous but hazardous.
Roads were bad and vessels weak and slow. Hardships and danger
beset his almost continuous voyages and journeys. A number of
poems relating the adventures of the traveler are reminiscenses of
his own experiences.</p>
<p>But his work of visiting the churches constituted, of course,
only a part of his duties. He had to preach in the cathedral at
Odense at least every Wednesday in Lent and on all festival Sundays;
examine the work and conduct of all pastors within the
diocese; act as an arbiter in disputes between them and their parishioners;
make sure that the financial affairs of the church and
its institutions were honestly conducted; attend to the collection
of church taxes; and superintend all schools, hospitals and institutions
of charity. The efficient accomplishment of all these tasks
might well test the strength and ability of any man.</p>
<p>His manifold duties also engendered numerous occasions for
friction, especially with the civil authorities, whose rights and
duties often overlapped his own. And he did not escape the danger
of such bickerings with their resultant ill-feeling. There is nothing
to indicate that he was contentious by nature. But he was no doubt
zealous in defending the prerogatives of his office. His temper was
quick and somewhat martial. &ldquo;One could very well,&rdquo; one of his
biographers declares, &ldquo;envision him as a knight in full armor
leading a troop in the charge.&rdquo; With the exception of his active
enemies, most of his contemporaries agree, however, that he was
commonly more than patient in his dealings with others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_52">[52]</div>
<p>Kingo was an able administrator, and the institutions and finances
of the diocese prospered under his care. But it was as an earnest
Christian and a tireless worker for the spiritual improvement
of his people that he won their respect. He was known as an &ldquo;eloquent
man, mighty in the Scriptures.&rdquo; One of his contemporaries
said of him: &ldquo;Were we not forced after hearing him preach to say
with the disciples, &lsquo;Did not our hearts burn within us when he
opened the Scriptures to us and, like a son of thunder, published
the sins of the house of Jacob, or, like Barnabas, the son of comfort,
bound up our wounds and comforted us with the comfort with
which he had himself been so richly comforted by God.&rsquo;&rdquo; The few
extracts of his sermons that have come down to us verify the truth
of this statement. They show us a man firmly grounded in his
own faith and zealous in impressing its truth upon others. His
preaching was strictly orthodox and yet fiery and practical. The
poetical language and forceful eloquence of his sermons remind
one of the best of his spiritual songs.</p>
<p>Kingo&rsquo;s writings and frequent travels brought him into contact
with most of the outstanding personages of his country in his
day. His charming personality, lively conversation and fine
sense of humor made him a welcome guest wherever he appeared.
On the island of Taasinge, he was a frequent and beloved guest in
the stately castle of the famous, pious and revered admiral, Niels
Juul, and his equally beloved wife, Birgitte Ulfeldt. His friendship
with this worthy couple was intimate and lasting. When admiral
Juul died, Kingo wrote the beautiful epitaph that still adorns his
tomb in the Holmen church at Copenhagen. On the island of Falster
he often visited the proud and domineering ex-queen, Carolina
Amalia. He was likewise a frequent visitor at the neighboring
estate of the once beautiful and adored daughter of king Christian
IV, Leonora Ulfeldt, whom the pride and hatred of the ex-queen
had consigned for twenty-two years to a dark and lonely
prison cell. Years of suffering, as we learn from her still famous
book <i>Memories of Misery</i>, had made the princess a deeply religious
woman. Imprisonment had aged her body, but had neither dulled
her brilliant mind nor hardened her heart. She spent her remaining
years in doing good, and she was a great admirer of Kingo.</p>
<p>Thus duty and inclination alike brought him in contact with
people of very different stations and conditions in life. His position
and high personal endowments made him a notable figure wherever
he went. But he had his enemies and detractors as well as
<span class="pb" id="pg_53">[53]</span>
his friends. It was not everyone who could see why a poor weaver&rsquo;s
son should be raised to such a high position. Kingo was accused
of being greedy, vain, over-ambitious and self-seeking, all of which
probably contained at least a grain of truth. We should have missed
some of his greatest hymns, if he had been a saint, and not a man
of flesh and blood, of passionate feelings and desires, a man who
knew from his own experiences that without Christ he could do
nothing.</p>
<p>Despite certain peculiar complications, Kingo&rsquo;s private life was
quite happy. Four years after the death of his first wife, he entered
into marriage with Johanne Lund, a widow many years older
than he. She brought with her a daughter from her former marriage.
And Kingo thus had the exceptional experience of being
stepfather to three sets of children, the daughter of his second wife
and the children and stepchildren of his first. To be the head of
such a family must inevitably have presented confusing problems
to a man who had no children of his own. But with the exception
of his stepson, all the children appear to have loved him and
maintained their relation to him as long as he lived.</p>
<p>His second wife died in 1694, when she was seventy-six and he
sixty years old. During the later years of her life she had been a
helpless invalid, demanding a great deal of patience and care of her
busy husband. Contemporaries comment on the frequent sight of
the famous bishop good-humoredly carrying his wife about like a
helpless child. Less than a year after her death, Kingo entered into
a new marriage, this time with an attractive young lady of the
nobility, Birgitte Balslev, his junior by more than thirty years. This
new marriage provoked a great deal of gossip and many predictions
of disaster on account of the great disparity in years of the
contracting parties. But the predictions proved wholly unfounded,
and the marriage singularly happy. Kingo and Birgitte, a contemporary
tells us, were &ldquo;inseparable as heart and soul.&rdquo; She was an
accomplished and highly intelligent woman, and Kingo found in
her, perhaps for the first time in his life, a woman with whom he
could share fully the rich treasure of his own heart and mind. He
is credited with the remark that he had done what all ought to do:
married an elderly woman in his young days, whom he could care
for when she grew old, and a young woman in his later years, who
could comfort him in his old age.</p>
<p>But Kingo did not show the effect of his years. He was still as
energetic and vigorous as ever in the prosecution of his manifold
<span class="pb" id="pg_54">[54]</span>
duties. For a number of years after his marriage, he even continued
his strenuous visits to all parts of his see, now always accompanied
by his wife. His leisure hours were usually spent on
a beautiful estate a few miles from Odense, which belonged to his
wife. At this favored retreat and in the company of friends, he
still could relax and become the liveliest of them all.</p>
<p>The years, however, would not be denied. At the turn of the
century, he suffered a first attack of the illness, a bladder complaint,
that later laid him in his grave. He made light of it and refused
to ease his strenuous activity. But the attack returned with
increasing frequency and, on a visit to Copenhagen in the fall of
1702, he was compelled to take to his bed. He recovered somewhat
and was able to return home. But it was now clear to all that the
days of the great bishop were numbered. Early in the new year he
became bedfast and suffered excruciatingly at times. &ldquo;But he submitted
himself wholly to God&rsquo;s will and bore his terrible suffering
with true Christian patience,&rdquo; one of his biographers tells us. To
those who asked about his condition, his invariable answer was,
that all was well with him. If anyone expressed sympathy with
him, he usually smiled and said that &ldquo;it could not be expected that
the two old friends, soul and body, should part from each other
without pain.&rdquo; When someone prayed or sang for him he followed
him eagerly, expressing his interest with his eyes, hands and whole
being.</p>
<p>A week before his death he called the members of his family
to his bed, shared the Holy Communion with them and thanked
them and especially his wife, for their great kindness to him during
his illness. On October 13, a Saturday, he slept throughout
the day, but awoke in the evening and exclaimed: &ldquo;Lord God, tomorrow
we shall hear wonderful music!&rdquo; And on the morning of
October 14, 1703, just as the great bells of the cathedral of St. Knud
called people to the service, his soul departed peacefully to join
the Church above. God had heard at last the earnest prayer of his
own great hymns:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But, O Jesus, I am crying:</p>
<p class="t0">Help that faith, on Thee relying,</p>
<p class="t0">Over sin and sorrow may</p>
<p class="t0">Ever rise and win the day.</p>
</div>
<p>His body was laid to rest in a small village church a few miles
outside of Odense. There one still may see the stone of his tomb,
<span class="pb" id="pg_55">[55]</span>
bearing an inscription that likens him to a sun which, although it
has set, still lights the way for all true lovers of virtue. Other
monuments to his memory have been raised at Slangerup, Odense and
other places. But his finest and most lasting memorials are his own
great hymns. In these his warm, passionate spirit still speaks to
a larger audience than he ever reached in his own day. The years
have served only to emphasize the truth of Grundtvig&rsquo;s beautiful
epitaph to him on his monument at Odense:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thomas Kingo is the psalmist</p>
<p class="t0">Of the Danish temple choir.</p>
<p class="t0">This his people will remember</p>
<p class="t0">Long as song their hearts inspire.</p>

<h2>Hans Adolph Brorson, the Christmas Singer of Denmark</h2>
<div id="c08" title="Brorson&rsquo;s Childhood and Youth">
<div class="pb" id="pg_59">[59]</div>
<h4>Chapter Eight
<span class="chaptertitle">Brorson&rsquo;s Childhood and Youth</span></h4>
<p>Hans Adolph Brorson came from Schleswig, the border
province between Denmark and Germany which for centuries has constituted
a battleground between the two countries
and cost the Danes so much in blood and tears. His family
was old in the district and presented an unbroken line of substantial
farmers until his grandfather, Broder Pedersen, broke it by
studying for the ministry and becoming pastor at Randrup, a small
country parish on the west coast of the province.</p>
<p>Broder Pedersen remained at Randrup till his death in 1646,
and was then succeeded by his son, Broder Brodersen, a young
man only twenty-three years old, who shortly before his installation
had married Catherine Margaret Clausen, a daughter of the
manager of Trojborg manor, the estate to which the church at
Randrup belonged. Catherine Clausen bore her husband three
sons, Nicolaj Brodersen, born July 23, 1690, Broder Brodersen,
born September 12, 1692, and Hans Adolph Brodersen&mdash;or Brorson&mdash;as
his name was later written&mdash;born June 20, 1694.</p>
<p>Broder Brodersen was a quiet, serious-minded man, anxious
to give his boys the best possible training for life. Although his
income was small, he managed somehow to provide private tutors
for them. Both he and his wife were earnest Christians, and the
fine example of their own lives was no doubt of greater value to
their boys than the formal instruction they received from hired
teachers. Thus an early biographer of the Brorsons writes: &ldquo;Their
good parents earnestly instructed their boys in all that was good,
but especially in the fear and knowledge of God. Knowing that a
good example is more productive of good than the best precept,
they were not content with merely teaching them what is good,
but strove earnestly to live so that their own daily lives might present
a worthy pattern for their sons to follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Broder Brodersen was not granted the privilege of seeing his
sons attain their honored manhood. He died in 1704, when the
<span class="pb" id="pg_60">[60]</span>
eldest of them was fourteen and the youngest only ten years old.
Upon realizing that he must leave them, he is said to have comforted
himself with the words of Kingo:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">If for my children I</p>
<p class="t0">Would weep and sorrow</p>
<p class="t0">And every moment cry:</p>
<p class="t0">Who shall tomorrow</p>
<p class="t0">With needful counsel, home and care provide them?</p>
<p class="t0">The Lord still reigns above,</p>
<p class="t0">He will with changeless love</p>
<p class="t0">Sustain and guide them.</p>
</div>
<p>Nor was the faith of the dying pastor put to shame. A year after
his death, his widow married his successor in the pastorate, Pastor
Ole Holbeck, who proved himself a most excellent stepfather to
his adopted sons.</p>
<p>Reverend Holbeck personally taught the boys until Nicolaj,
and a year later, Broder and Hans Adolph were prepared to enter
the Latin school at Ribe. This old and once famous school was then
in a state of decay. The town itself had declined from a proud city,
a favored residence of kings and nobles, to an insignificant village
of about fifteen hundred inhabitants. Of its former glory only a
few old buildings and, especially, the beautiful cathedral still remained.
And the Latin school had shared the fate of the city. Its
once fine buildings were decaying; its faculty, which in former
times included some of the best known savants of the country, was
poorly paid and poorly equipped; and the number of its students
had shrunk from about 1200 to less than a score. Only the course
of study remained unchanged from the Middle Ages. Latin and
religion were still the main subjects of instruction. It mattered
little if the student could neither speak nor write Danish correctly,
but he must be able to define the finest points in a Latin grammar
of more than 1200 pages. Attendance at religious services was compulsory;
but the services were cold and spiritless, offering little
attraction to an adolescent youth.</p>
<p>The boys completed their course at Ribe and entered the university
of Copenhagen, Nicolaj in the fall of 1710 and the younger
brothers a year later. But the change offered them little improvement.
The whole country suffered from a severe spiritual decline.
Signs of an awakening were here and there, but not at the university
where Lutheran orthodoxy still maintained its undisputed
reign of more than a hundred years, though it had now become
more dry and spiritless than ever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_61">[61]</div>
<p>The brothers all intended to prepare for the ministry. But after
two years Nicolaj for various reasons left the University of Copenhagen
to complete his course at the University of Kiel. Broder
remained at Copenhagen, completing his course there in the spring
of 1715. Hans Adolph studied for three years more and, even then,
failed to complete his course.</p>
<div class="img" title="Hans Adolph Brorson">
<img height="631" width="500" alt="Hans Adolph Brorson" src="images/brorson.png" />
<p class="center">Hans Adolph Brorson</p>
</div>
<p>It was a period of transition and spiritual unrest. The spiritual
revival now clearly discernible throughout the country had at
last reached the university. For the first time in many years the
prevailing orthodoxy with its settled answers to every question
of faith and conduct was meeting an effective challenge. Many
turned definitely away from religion, seeking in other fields such
as history, philosophy and especially the natural sciences for a
more adequate answer to their problems than religion appeared to
offer. Others searched for a solution of their difficulty in new
approaches to the old faith. The result was a spiritual confusion such
as often precedes the dawn of a new awakening. And Brorson appears
<span class="pb" id="pg_62">[62]</span>
to have been caught in it. His failure to complete his course
was by no means caused by indolence. He had, on the contrary,
broadened his studies to include a number of subjects foreign to
his course, and he had worked so hard that he had seriously impaired
his health. But he had lost his direction, and also, for the time
being, all interest in theology.</p>
<p>It was, therefore, as a somewhat spiritually confused and
physically broken young man that he gave up his studies and returned
to his home at Randrup. His brothers were already well
started upon their conspicuously successful careers, while he was
still drifting, confused and uncertain, a failure, as some no doubt
would call him. His good stepfather, nevertheless, received him
with the utmost kindness. If he harbored any disappointment in
him, he does not appear to have shown it. His stepson remained
with him for about a year, assisting him with whatever he could,
and had then so far recovered that he was able to accept a position
as tutor in the family of his maternal uncle, Nicolaj Clausen, at
L&oslash;gum Kloster.</p>
<p>L&oslash;gum Kloster had once been a large and powerful institution
and a center of great historic events. The magnificent building of
the cloister itself had been turned into a county courthouse, at
which Nicolaj Clausen served as county president, but the splendid
old church of the cloister still remained, serving as the parish
church. In these interesting surroundings and in the quiet family
circle of his uncle, Brorson made further progress toward normal
health. But his full recovery came only after a sincere spiritual
awakening in 1720.</p>
<p>The strong revival movement that was sweeping the country
and displacing the old orthodoxy, was engendered by the German
Pietist movement, entering Denmark through Slesvig. The two
conceptions of Christianity differed, it has been said, only in their
emphasis. Orthodoxy emphasized doctrine and Pietism, life. Both
conceptions were one-sided. If orthodoxy had resulted in a lifeless
formalism, Pietism soon lost its effectiveness in a sentimental subjectivism.
Its neglect of sound doctrine eventually gave birth to
Rationalism. But for the moment Pietism appeared to supply what
orthodoxy lacked: an urgent call to Christians to live what they
professed to believe.</p>
<p>A number of the early leaders of the movement in Denmark
lived in the neighborhood of L&oslash;gum Kloster, and were personally
known to Brorson. But whether or not any of these leaders was
<span class="pb" id="pg_63">[63]</span>
instrumental in his awakening is now unknown. One of his contemporaries
simply states that &ldquo;Brorson at this time sought to employ
his solitude in a closer walk with God in Christ and, in so doing,
received a perfect assurance of the Lord&rsquo;s faithfulness to those that
trust in Him.&rdquo; Thus whatever influence neighboring Pietists may
have contributed to the great change in his life, the change itself
seems to have been brought about through his own Jacob-like
struggle with God. And it was a complete change. If he had formerly
been troubled by many things, he henceforth evinced but
one desire to know Christ and to be known by Him.</p>
<p>A first fruit of his awakening was an eager desire to enter the
ministry. He was offered a position as rector of a Latin school, but
his stepfather&rsquo;s death, just as he was considering the offer, caused
him to refuse the appointment and instead to apply for the pastorate
at Randrup. His application granted, he at once hastened back
to the university to finish his formerly uncompleted course and obtain
his degree. Having accomplished this in the fall of the same
year, on April 6, 1722, he was ordained to the ministry together
with his brother, Broder Brorson, who had resigned a position as
rector of a Latin school to become pastor at Mjolden, a parish adjoining
Randrup. As his brother, Nicolaj Brorson, shortly before
had accepted the pastorate of another adjoining parish, the three
brothers thus enjoyed the unusual privilege of living and working
together in the same neighborhood.</p>
<p>The eight years that Brorson spent at Randrup where his father
and grandfather had worked before him were probably the
happiest in his life. The parish is located in a low, treeless plain
bordering the North Sea. Its climate, except for a few months of
summer, is raw and blustery. In stormy weather the sea frequently
floods its lower fields, causing severe losses in crops, stocks and
even in human life. Thus Brorson&rsquo;s stepfather died from a cold
caught during a flight from a flood that threatened the parsonage.
The severe climate and constant threat of the sea, however, fosters
a hardy race. From this region the Jutes together with their neighbors,
the Angles and Saxons, once set out to conquer and settle
the British Isles. And the hardihood of the old sea-rovers was not
wholly lost in their descendants when Brorson settled among them,
although it had long been directed into other and more peaceful
channels.</p>
<p>The parsonage in which the Brorsons lived stood on a low
ridge, rising gently above its surroundings and affording a splendid
<span class="pb" id="pg_64">[64]</span>
view over far reaches of fields, meadows and the ever changing
sea. The view was especially beautiful in early summer when wild
flowers carpeted the meadows in a profusion of colors, countless
birds soared and sang above the meadows and shoals of fish played
in the reed bordered streams. It was without doubt this scene that
inspired the splendid hymn &ldquo;Arise, All Things that God Hath
Made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brorson was happy to return to Randrup. The parish was just
then the center of all that was dearest to him in this world. His
beloved mother still lived there, his brothers were close neighbors,
and he brought with him his young wife, Catherine Clausen, whom
he had married a few days before his installation.</p>
<p>Nicolaj and Broder Brorson had, like him, joined the Pietist
movement, and the three brothers, therefore, could work together
in complete harmony for the spiritual revival of their parishes.
And they did not spare themselves. Both separately and cooperatively,
they labored zealously to increase church attendance, revive
family devotions, encourage Bible reading and hymn singing,
and minimize the many worldly and doubtful amusements that,
then as now, caused many Christians to fall. They also began to
hold private assemblies in the homes, a work for which they were
bitterly condemned by many and severely reprimanded by the
authorities. It could not be expected, of course, that a work so
devoted to the furtherance of a new conception of the Christian
life would be tolerated without opposition. But their work, nevertheless,
was blest with abundant fruit, both in their own parishes
and throughout neighboring districts. Churches were refilled with
worshippers, family altars rebuilt, and a new song was born in
thousands of homes. People expressed their love for the three
brothers by naming them &ldquo;The Rare Three-Leafed Clover from
Randrup.&rdquo; It is said that the revival inspired by the Brorsons even
now, more than two hundred years later, is plainly evident in the
spiritual life of the district.</p>
<p>Thus the years passed fruitfully for the young pastor at Randrup.
He rejoiced in his home, his work and the warm devotion
of his people. It came, therefore, as a signal disappointment to all
that he was the first to break the happy circle by accepting a call
as assistant pastor at Christ church in T&oslash;nder, a small city a few
miles south of Randrup.</p>
</div>
<div id="c09" title="The Singer of Pietism">
<div class="pb" id="pg_65">[65]</div>
<h4>Chapter Nine
<span class="chaptertitle">The Singer of Pietism</span></h4>
<p>The city of T&oslash;nder, when Brorson located there, had about
two thousand inhabitants. At one time it had belonged to
the German Dukes of Gottorp, and it was still largely German
speaking. Its splendid church had three pastors, two of whom
preached in German and the third, Brorson, in Danish.</p>
<p>The parish Pastor, Johan Herman Schraeder, was an outstanding
and highly respected man. Born at Hamburg in 1684, he
had in his younger days served as a tutor for the children of King
Frederick IV, Princess Charlotte Amalia and Prince Christian,
now reigning as King Christian VI.</p>
<p>Pastor Schraeder was a zealous Pietist and a leader of the
Pietist movement in T&oslash;nder and its neighboring territory. Like
the Brorsons he sought to encourage family devotions, Bible reading
and, especially, hymn singing. People are said to have become
so interested in the latter that they brought their hymnals
with them to work so that they might sing from them during lunch
hours. He himself was a noted hymnwriter and hymn collector,
who, shortly after Brorson became his assistant, published a German
hymnal, containing no less than 1157 hymns.</p>
<p>Schraeder, we are told, had been personally active in inducing
Brorson to leave his beloved Randrup and accept the call to
T&oslash;nder. As Brorson was known as an ardent Pietist, Schraeder&rsquo;s
interest in bringing him to T&oslash;nder may have originated in a natural
wish to secure a congenial co-worker, but it may also have
sprung from an acquaintance with his work as a hymnwriter. For
although there is no direct evidence that any of Brorson&rsquo;s hymns
were written at Randrup, a number of circumstances make it
highly probable that some of them were composed there and that
Schraeder was acquainted with them. Such a mutual interest
also helps to explain why Brorson should leave his fruitful work
at Randrup for an inferior position in a new field. It is certain
that the change brought him no outward advantages, and his
position as a Danish pastor in a largely German speaking community
must have presented certain unavoidable difficulties.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_66">[66]</div>
<p>Although Brorson to our knowledge took no part in the endless
contest between German and Danish, his personal preference was,
no doubt, for the latter. It is thus significant that, although he must
have been about equally familiar with both languages, he did not
write a single hymn in German. He showed no ill will toward his
German speaking compatriots, however, and worked harmoniously
with his German speaking co-workers. But this strongly
German atmosphere does constitute a peculiar setting for one of
the greatest hymnwriters of the Danish church.</p>
<p>The congregation at T&oslash;nder had formed the peculiar custom of
singing in German&mdash;even at the Danish service. It is self-evident,
however, that such a custom could not be satisfactory to Brorson.
He was a Pietist with the fervent longing of that movement for a
real spiritual communion with his fellow Christians. But a custom
that compelled the pastor and his congregation to speak in different
tongues was, of necessity, a hindrance to the consummation
of such a desire. And now Christmas was drawing near, that
joyful season which Brorson, as his hymns prove, loved so well
and must heartily have desired to share with his hearers, a desire
which this mixture of tongues to a certain extent, made impossible.
He and his congregation had to be one in language before they
could wholly be one in spirit.</p>
<p>And so, shortly before the great festival in 1732, he published a
small and unpretentious booklet entitled: <b>Some Christmas Hymns,
Composed to the Honor of God, the Edification of Christian Souls
and, in Particular, of My Beloved Congregation during the Approaching
Joyful Christmastide, Humbly and Hastily Written by
Hans Adolph Brorson</b>.</p>
<p>This simple appearing booklet at once places Brorson among the
great hymnwriters of the Christian church. It contains ten hymns,
seven of which are for the Christmas season. Nearly every one
of them is now counted among the classics of Danish hymnody.</p>
<p>Brorson seems at once to have reached the height of his ability
as a hymnwriter. His Christmas hymns present an intensity of
sentiment, a mastery of form and a perfection of poetical skill that
he rarely attained in his later work. They are frankly lyrical.
Unlike his great English contemporary, Isaac Watts, who held that
a hymn should not be a lyrical poem and deliberately reduced
the poetical quality of his work, Brorson believed that a Christian
should use &ldquo;all his thought and skill to magnify the grace of God&rdquo;.
The opinion of an English literary critic &ldquo;that hymns cannot be
<span class="pb" id="pg_67">[67]</span>
considered as poetry&rdquo; is disproved by Brorson&rsquo;s work. Some of
his hymns contain poetry of the highest merit. Their phrasing is
in parts extremely lyrical, utilizing to the fullest extent the softness
and flexibility that is supposed to be an outstanding characteristic
of the Danish tongue; their metres are most skillfully blended
and their rhymes exceedingly varied. His masterly use of what
was often considered an inconsequential appendage to poetry is
extraordinarily skillful. Thus he frequently chooses a harsh or a
soft rhyme to emphasize the predominating sentiment of his verse.</p>
<p>Brorson is without doubt the most lyrical of all Danish hymnwriters.
Literary critics have rated some of his hymns with the
finest lyrics in the Danish language. Yet his poetry seldom degenerates
to a mere form. His fervid lyrical style usually serves
as an admirable vehicle for the warm religious sentiment of his song.</p>
<p>In their warm spirit and fervid style Brorson&rsquo;s hymns in some
ways strikingly resemble the work of his great English contemporaries,
the Wesleys. Nor is this similarity a mere chance. The
Wesleys, as we know, were strongly influenced first by the Moravians
and later by the German Pietists. Besides a number of
Moravian hymns, John Wesley also translated several hymns from
the hymnbook compiled by the well-known Pietist, Johan Freylinghausen.
The fervid style and varied metres of these hymns
introduced a new type of church song into the English and American
churches. But Freylinghausen&rsquo;s <b>Gesang-Buch</b> also formed the
basis of the hymnal compiled by Johan Herman Schraeder from
which Brorson chose most of the originals of his translations. Thus
both he and the Wesleys in a measure drew their inspiration from
the same source. The Danish poet and his English contemporaries
worked independently and mediated their inspiration in their
own way, but the resemblance of their work is unmistakable. In
poetical merit, however, the work of Brorson far excels that of
the Wesleys. But his Christmas hymns also surpass most earlier
Danish hymns and even the greater part of his own later work.</p>
<p>One&rsquo;s first impression of the booklet that so greatly has enriched
the Christmas festival of Denmark and Norway, is likely to
be disappointing. At the time of Brorson the festival was frequently
desecrated by a ceaseless round of worldly amusements.
People attended the festival services of the church and spent the
remainder of the season in a whirl of secular and far from innocent
pleasures. With his Pietistic views Brorson naturally deplored
<span class="pb" id="pg_68">[68]</span>
such a misuse of the season. And his first hymn, therefore, sounds
an earnest call to cease these unseemly pleasures and to use the
festival in a Christian way.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Cast out all worldly pleasure</p>
<p class="t0">This blessed Christmastide,</p>
<p class="t0">And seek the boundless treasure</p>
<p class="t0">That Jesus doth provide.</p>
</div>
<p>But although such a warning may have been timely, then as
now, it hardly expresses the real Christmas spirit. In the next
hymn, however, he at once strikes the true festival note in one
of the most triumphant Christmas anthems in the Danish or any
other language.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">This blessed Christmastide we will,</p>
<p class="t0">With heart and mind rejoicing,</p>
<p class="t0">Employ our every thought and skill,</p>
<p class="t0">God&rsquo;s grace and honor voicing.</p>
<p class="t0">In Him that in the manger lay</p>
<p class="t0">We will with all our might today</p>
<p class="t0">Exult in heart and spirit,</p>
<p class="t0">And hail Him as our Lord and King</p>
<p class="t0">Till earth&rsquo;s remotest bounds shall ring</p>
<p class="t0">With praises of His merit.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">A little Child of Jesse&rsquo;s stem,</p>
<p class="t0">And Son of God in heaven,</p>
<p class="t0">To earth from heaven&rsquo;s glory came</p>
<p class="t0">And was for sinners given.</p>
<p class="t0">It so distressed His loving heart</p>
<p class="t0">To see the world from God depart</p>
<p class="t0">And in transgression languish,</p>
<p class="t0">That He forsook His home above</p>
<p class="t0">And came to earth in tender love</p>
<p class="t0">To bear our grief and anguish.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Therefore we hymn His praises here</p>
<p class="t0">And though we are but lowly,</p>
<p class="t0">Our loud hosannas everywhere</p>
<p class="t0">Shall voice His mercy holy.</p>
<p class="t0">The tent of God is now with man,</p>
<p class="t0">And He will dwell with us again</p>
<p class="t0">When in His name assembling.</p>

</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And though our song of joy be fraught</p>

<p class="t0">Subdue our jubilation.</p>
<p class="t0">For when the heart is most distressed,</p>
<p class="t0">The harp of joy is tuned so best</p>
<p class="t0">Its chords of joy are ringing,</p>
<p class="t0">And broken hearts best comprehend</p>
<p class="t0">The boundless joy our Lord and Friend</p>
<p class="t0">This Christmas day is bringing.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Hallelujah, our strife is o&rsquo;er!</p>
<p class="t0">Who would henceforth with sadness</p>
<p class="t0">Repine and weep in sorrow sore</p>
<p class="t0">This blessed day of gladness.</p>
<p class="t0">Rejoice, rejoice, ye saints on earth,</p>
<p class="t0">And sing the wonders of His birth</p>
<p class="t0">Whose glory none can measure.</p>
<p class="t0">Hallelujah, the Lord is mine,</p>
<p class="t0">And I am now by grace divine</p>
<p class="t0">The heir of all His treasure!</p>
</div>
<p>Equally fine but more quietly contemplative is the next hymn
in the collection which takes us right to the focal point of Christmas
worship, the stable at Bethlehem.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">My heart remains in wonder</p>
<p class="t0">Before that lowly bed</p>
<p class="t0">Within the stable yonder</p>
<p class="t0">Where Christ, my Lord, was laid.</p>
<p class="t0">My faith finds there its treasure,</p>
<p class="t0">My soul its pure delight,</p>
<p class="t0">Its joy beyond all measure,</p>
<p class="t0">The Lord of Christmas night.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But Oh! my heart is riven</p>
<p class="t0">With grief and sore dismay</p>
<p class="t0">To see the Lord of heaven</p>
<p class="t0">Must rest on straw and hay,</p>
<p class="t0">That He whom angels offer</p>
<p class="t0">Their worship and acclaim</p>
<p class="t0">From sinful man must suffer</p>
<p class="t0">Such scorn, neglect and shame.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Why should not castles royal</p>
<p class="t0">Before Him open stand,</p>
<p class="t0">And kings, as servants loyal,</p>
<p class="t0">Obey His least command?</p>
<p class="t0">Why came He not in splendor</p>
<p class="t0">Arrayed in robes of light</p>
<p class="t0">And called the world to render</p>
<p class="t0">Its homage to His might?</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_70">[70]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The sparrow finds a gable</p>
<p class="t0">Where it may build its nest,</p>
<p class="t0">The oxen know a stable</p>

<p class="t0">Must then my Lord and Savior</p>
<p class="t0">A homeless stranger be,</p>

<p class="t0">To Thee, who made it free.</p>
<p class="t0">Thou shalt find there a manger</p>
<p class="t0">Warmed by my love to Thee.</p>
</div>
<p>Far different from this song of quiet contemplation is the
searching hymn that follows it.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">How do we exalt the Father</p>
<p class="t0">That He sent His Son to earth.</p>
<p class="t0">Many with indifference gather</p>
<p class="t0">At His gift of boundless worth.</p>
</div>
<p>This is followed by another hymn of praise.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lift up your voice once more</p>
<p class="t0">The Savior to adore.</p>
<p class="t0">Let all unite in spirit</p>
<p class="t0">And praise the grace and merit</p>
<p class="t0">Of Jesus Christ, the Holy,</p>
<p class="t0">Our joy and glory solely.</p>
</div>
<p>And then comes &ldquo;The Fairest of Roses&rdquo;, which a distinguished
critic calls &ldquo;one of the most perfect lyrics in the Danish language&rdquo;.
This hymn is inspired by a text from the Song of Songs &ldquo;I am the
rose of Sharon and the lily of the valley&rdquo;. It is written as
an allegory, a somewhat subdued form of expression that in this
case serves admirably to convey an impression of restrained fire.
Its style is reminiscent of the folk songs, with the first stanza
introducing the general theme of the song, the appearance of the
rose, that is, of the Savior in a lost and indifferent world. The
remainder of the verses are naturally divided into three parts: a
description of the dying world in which God causes the rose to
appear, a lament over the world&rsquo;s indifference to the gift which it
should have received with joy and gratitude, and a glowing
declaration of what the rose means to the poet himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_71">[71]</div>
<p>Many chapters have been written about the poetic excellencies
of this hymn, such as the perfect balance of its parts, the admirable
treatment of the contrast between the rose and the thorns,
and the skillful choice of rhymes to underscore the predominating
sentiment of each verse. But some of these excellencies have no
doubt been lost in the translation and can be appreciated only
by a study of the original. English translations of the hymn have
been made by German-, Swedish-, and Norwegian-American writers,
indicating its wide popularity. The following is but another
attempt to produce a more adequate rendering of this beautiful
song.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Now found is the fairest of roses,</p>
<p class="t0">Midst briars it sweetly reposes.</p>
<p class="t0">My Jesus, unsullied and holy,</p>
<p class="t0">Abode among sinners most lowly.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Since man his Creator deserted,</p>
<p class="t0">And wholly His image perverted,</p>
<p class="t0">The world like a desert was lying,</p>
<p class="t0">And all in transgressions were dying.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But God, as His promises granted,</p>
<p class="t0">A rose in the desert hath planted,</p>
<p class="t0">Which now with its sweetness endoweth</p>
<p class="t0">The race that in sinfulness groweth.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">All people should now with sweet savor</p>
<p class="t0">Give praise unto God for His favor;</p>
<p class="t0">But many have ne&rsquo;er comprehended</p>
<p class="t0">The rose to the world hath descended.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Ye sinners as vile in behavior</p>
<p class="t0">As thorns in the crown of the Savior,</p>
<p class="t0">Why are ye so prideful in spirit,</p>
<p class="t0">Content with your self-righteous merit?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O seek ye the places more lowly,</p>
<p class="t0">And weep before Jesus, the Holy,</p>
<p class="t0">Then come ye His likeness the nearest;</p>
<p class="t0">The rose in the valley grows fairest.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">My Jesus, Thou ever remainest</p>
<p class="t0">My wonderful rose who sustainest</p>
<p class="t0">My heart in the fullness of pleasure;</p>
<p class="t0">Thy sweetness alone I will treasure.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The world may of all things bereave me,</p>
<p class="t0">Its thorns may assail and aggrieve me,</p>
<p class="t0">The foe may great anguish engender:</p>
<p class="t0">My rose I will never surrender.</p>

<p>The last Christmas hymn of the collection is printed under the
heading: &ldquo;A Little Hymn for the Children&rdquo;, and is composed from
the text &ldquo;Have ye not read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings
thou hast perfected praise&rdquo;. Said to be the oldest children&rsquo;s
hymn in Danish, it is still one of the finest. It is written as a
processional. The children come hastening on to Bethlehem to find
the new-born Lord and offer Him their homage. One almost hears
their pattering feet and happy voices as they rush forward singing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Here come Thy little ones, O Lord,</p>
<p class="t0">To Thee in Bethlehem adored.</p>
<p class="t0">Enlighten now our heart and mind</p>
<p class="t0">That we the way to Thee may find.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">We hasten with a song to greet</p>
<p class="t0">And kneel before Thee at Thy feet.</p>
<p class="t0">O blessed hour, O sacred night,</p>
<p class="t0">When Thou wert born, our soul&rsquo;s Delight!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Be welcome from Thy heavenly home</p>
<p class="t0">Unto this vale of tears and gloom,</p>
<p class="t0">Where man to Thee no honor gave</p>
<p class="t0">But stable, manger, cross and grave.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But Jesus, oh! how can it be</p>
<p class="t0">That but so few will think of Thee</p>
<p class="t0">And of that tender, wondrous love</p>
<p class="t0">Which drew Thee to us from above?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O draw us little children near</p>
<p class="t0">To Thee, our Friend and Brother dear,</p>
<p class="t0">That each of us so heartily</p>
<p class="t0">In faith and love may cling to Thee.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Let not the world lead us astray</p>
<p class="t0">That we our Christian faith betray,</p>
<p class="t0">But grant that all our longings be</p>
<p class="t0">Directed always unto Thee.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Then shall the happy day once come</p>
<p class="t0">When we shall gather in Thy home</p>
<p class="t0">And join the angels&rsquo; joyful throng</p>
<p class="t0">In praising Thee with triumph song.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">We gather now about Thee close</p>
<p class="t0">Like leaves around the budding rose,</p>

<p>His Christmas hymns were so well received that Brorson was
encouraged to continue his writing. During the following year
he published no less than five collections bearing the titles: <b>Some
Advent Hymns</b>, <b>Some Passion Hymns</b>, <b>Some Easter Hymns</b>, <b>Some
Pentecost Hymns</b>, and <b>Hymns for the Minor Festivals</b>. All of these
hymns were likewise kindly received and therefore he continued
to send out new collections, publishing during the following years
a whole series of hymns on various phases of Christian faith and
life. In 1739, all these hymns were collected into one volume and
published under the title: <b>The Rare Clenod of Faith</b>.</p>
<p>This now famous book contains in all 67 original and 216 translated
hymns. The arrangement of the hymns follows in the main
the order of the Lutheran catechism, covering not only every
division but almost every subdivision of the book. Brorson, it
appears, must have written his hymns after a preconceived plan,
a rather unusual method for a hymnwriter to follow.</p>
<p><b>The Rare Clenod of Faith</b> fails as a whole to maintain the high
standard of the Christmas hymns. Although the language, as in
all that Brorson wrote, is pure and melodious, the poetic flight and
fresh sentiment of his earlier work is lacking to some extent in
the latter part of the collection. One reason for this is thought to
be that Brorson, on locating at T&oslash;nder, had come into closer contact
with the more extreme views of Pietism. The imprint of that
movement, at least, is more distinct upon his later than upon his
earlier work. The great preponderance of his translated over his
original hymns also affects the spirit of the collection. He was not
always fortunate in the selection of the original material for his
translations. Some of these express the excessive Pietistic contemplation
of the Savior&rsquo;s blood and wounds; others are rhymed
sermons rather than songs of praise.</p>
<p>Despite these defects, <b>The Rare Clenod of Faith</b>, still ranks
with the great books of hymnody. It contains a wealth of hymns
that will never die. Even the less successful of its compositions
present a true Evangelical message, a message that, at times,
sounds a stern call to awake and &ldquo;shake off that sinful sleep before
to you is closed the open door&rdquo; and, at others, pleads softly for a
closer walk with God, a deeper understanding of His ways and a
firmer trust in His grace. There are many strings on Brorson&rsquo;s
harp, but they all sound a note of vital faith.</p>
<p>Judging Brorson&rsquo;s original hymns to be far superior to his
translations, some have deplored that he should have spent so
<span class="pb" id="pg_74">[74]</span>
much of his time in transferring the work of others. And it is, no
doubt, true that his original hymns are as a whole superior to his
translations. But many of these are so fine that their elimination
would now appear like an irreplaceable loss to Danish hymnody.
The constant love with which many of them have been used for
more than two hundred years should silence the claim that a translated
hymn must of necessity be less valuable than an original. A
considerable number of the originals of Brorson&rsquo;s most favored
translations have long been forgotten.</p>
<p>As a translator Brorson is usually quite faithful to the originals,
following them as closely as the differences in language
and mode of expression permit. He is not slavishly bound, however,
to his text. His constant aim is to reproduce his text in a pure
and idiomatic Danish. And as his own poetic skill in most cases
was superior to that of the original writer, his translations are
often greatly superior to their originals in poetical merit.</p>
<p>Although the translation of a translation of necessity presents
a very unreliable yard-stick of a man&rsquo;s work, the following translation
of Brorson&rsquo;s version of the well-known German hymn, &ldquo;Ich
Will Dich Lieben, Meine Starke&rdquo; may at least indicate the nature
of his work as a translator.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thee will I love, my strength, my Treasure;</p>

<p>But fine as many of his translations are, Brorson&rsquo;s main claim
to fame must rest, of course, upon his original compositions.
These are of varying merit. His Christmas hymns were followed
by a number of hymns for the festivals of the church year. While
some of these are excellent, others are merely rhymed meditations
upon the meaning of the season and lack the freshness of his
Christmas anthems. The triumphant Easter hymn given below
belongs to the finest of the group.</p>
<div class="verse">

<p>Brorson&rsquo;s other hymns are too numerous to permit a more than
cursory review. Beginning with the subject of creation, he wrote
a number of excellent hymns on the work and providence of God.
Best known among these is the hymn given below, which is said
to have so pleased the king that he chose its author to become
bishop. The hymn is thought to have been written while Brorson
was still at Randrup. But whether this be so or not, it is evidently
inspired by the natural scenery of that locality.</p>

<p>The Pietist movement is known for its fervid glorification of
the Savior, and particularly of His blood and wounds, a glorification
which at times appears objectionable because of the too-familiar
and realistic terms in which it is expressed. Brorson did
not wholly escape the excesses of the movement in this respect,
<span class="pb" id="pg_78">[78]</span>
especially in his translations. In his original hymns the excesses
are less apparent. However faithful he might be to the movement
he possessed a wholesome restraint which, when he was
not following others, caused him to moderate its most inappropriate
extravagances. What can be more reverent than this beautiful
tribute to the Savior:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jesus, name of wondrous grace,</p>
<p class="t0">Fount of mercy and salvation,</p>
<p class="t0">First fruit of the new creation,</p>
<p class="t0">Weary sinners&rsquo; resting place,</p>

<p class="t0">Anchor of our hope and love,</p>
<p class="t0">Guide us in Thy footsteps glorious,</p>
<p class="t0">Bear us to Thy home above.</p>
</div>
<p>Or more expressive than this jubilant hymn of adoration:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Thou blest Immanuel!</p>
<p class="t0">What exceeding joy from heaven</p>
<p class="t0">Hast Thou caused in me to dwell</p>

<p class="t0">Jesus, Who mine anguish bore,</p>

</div>
<p>Most beautiful is also his hymn to the Lamb of God, translated
by Pastor D. G. M. Bach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_79">[79]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I see Thee stand, O Lamb of God,</p>
<p class="t0">On Zion&rsquo;s mountain peak.</p>
<p class="t0">But Oh the way that Thou hast trod,</p>
<p class="t0">So long, so hard, so bleak!</p>
<p class="t0">What Thou didst suffer for our woe,</p>
<p class="t0">No man can ever know.</p>
</div>
<p>Though Brorson made a number of excellent translations of
hymns to the Spirit such as the beautiful, &ldquo;Come, Rains from the
Heavens, to Strengthen and Nourish the Languishing Field,&rdquo; he
wrote no outstanding Pentecost hymns of his own composition.
It remained for Grundtvig to supply the Danish church with a
wealth of unexcelled hymns on the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>Aside from his Christmas hymns, Brorson&rsquo;s greatest contribution
to hymnody is perhaps his revival hymns, a type in which
the Lutheran church is rather poor. The special message of the
Pietist movement was an earnest call to awake, and Brorson
repeated that call with an appealing insistence and earnestness.
The word of God has been sown, but where are its fruits?</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Father, may Thy word prevail</p>
<p class="t0">Against the power of Hell!</p>
<p class="t0">Behold the vineyard Thou hast tilled</p>
<p class="t0">With thorns and thistles filled.</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis true, the plants are there,</p>
<p class="t0">But ah, how weak and rare,</p>
<p class="t0">How slight the power and evidence</p>
<p class="t0">Of word and sacraments.</p>
</div>
<p>It is, therefore, time for all Christians to awake.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Awaken from your idle dreaming!</p>
<p class="t0">Ye lukewarm Christians, now arise.</p>
<p class="t0">Behold, the light from heaven streaming</p>
<p class="t0">Proclaims the day of mercy flies.</p>
<p class="t0">Throw off that sinful sleep before</p>
<p class="t0">To you is closed the open door.</p>
</div>
<p>Many are heedless, taking no thought of the day when all shall
appear before the judgment of God. Such people should arouse
themselves and prepare for the rendering of their account.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O heart, prepare to give account</p>
<p class="t0">Of all thy sore transgression.</p>
<p class="t0">To God, of grace and love the Fount,</p>
<p class="t0">Make thou a full confession.</p>
<p class="t0">What hast thou done these many years</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_80">[80]</div>
<p class="t0">The Lord hath thee afforded.</p>
<p class="t0">Nothing but sin and earthly cares</p>
<p class="t0">Is in God&rsquo;s book recorded.</p>
</div>
<p>He realizes that many continue in their sin because of ignorance,
and with these he pleads so softly:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">If thou but knew the life that thou are leading</p>
<p class="t0">In sin and shame is Satan&rsquo;s tyranny,</p>
<p class="t0">Thou wouldest kneel and with the Lord be pleading</p>
<p class="t0">That He thy soul from bondage would set free.</p>
<p class="t0">Oh, how the Saviour would rejoice</p>
<p class="t0">If thou today should&rsquo;st listen to His voice!</p>
</div>
<p>And the day of salvation is now at hand.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O, seek the Lord today,</p>
<p class="t0">Today He hath salvation.</p>
<p class="t0">Approach Him while He may</p>
<p class="t0">Still hear thy supplication.</p>
<p class="t0">Repent and seek His grace</p>
<p class="t0">While yet His call doth sound,</p>
<p class="t0">Yea turn to Him thy face</p>
<p class="t0">While still He may be found.</p>
</div>
<p>Orthodoxy had instilled a formal, but often spiritless faith.
Pietism aimed to awaken the great mass of formal believers to a
new life, a living and active faith. This is strongly expressed in
the very popular hymn below.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The faith that Christ embraces<sup><a id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p class="t0">And purifies the hearts</p>
<p class="t0">The faith that boldly faces</p>
<p class="t0">The devil&rsquo;s fiery darts,</p>
<p class="t0">That faith is strong and must</p>
<p class="t0">Withstand the world&rsquo;s temptation</p>
<p class="t0">And in all tribulation,</p>
<p class="t0">In Christ, the Saviour, trust.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The faith that knows no struggle</p>
<p class="t0">Against the power of sin,</p>
<p class="t0">The faith that sounds no bugle</p>
<p class="t0">To waken, fight and win,</p>
<p class="t0">That faith is dead and vain,</p>
<p class="t0">Its sacred name disgracing,</p>
<p class="t0">And impotent when facing</p>
<p class="t0">The devil&rsquo;s mighty reign.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">A Christian wears his armor</p>

<p class="t0">If he would win his glorious</p>
<p class="t0">Reward at God&rsquo;s right hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">It is a comfort pleasing</p>
<p class="t0">In our embattled life,</p>
<p class="t0">To feel our strength increasing</p>

<p class="t0">And as our days shall be</p>

<p class="t0">And with His gifts reward us</p>
<p class="t0">When striving faithfully.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">

<p>Although Brorson knew that&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The cost is greater than at first expected</p>
<p class="t0">To be in God's unbounded gifts perfected.</p>
</div>
<p>he holds that</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">It does not cost too hard a strife</p>
<p class="t0">To be a Christian, pure and heaven-minded,&mdash;</p>
</div>
<p>But a Christian must be steadfast and persevering, as he admonishes
himself and others in the following very popular hymn.
The translation is by Pastor P. C. Paulsen.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Stand fast, my soul, stand fast</p>
<p class="t0">In Christ, thy Saviour!</p>

<p>Therefore children of God should rejoice.</p>

</div>
<p>But even a child of God must not expect to escape from the
common trials and perils of life. God promises assistance but not
exemption to those who love Him. In the following striking hymn,
Brorson vividly pictures both the trials and the comfort of a
child of God.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I walk in danger everywhere,<sup><a id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a></sup></p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_84">[84]</div>
<p>Unlike Kingo and Grundtvig, Brorson wrote no outstanding
hymns on the sacraments. Pietism was in the main a revival
movement and placed no special emphasis on the means of grace.
And although Brorson remained a loyal son of the established
church, he wrote his finest hymns on those phases of Christianity
most earnestly emphasized by the movement to which he belonged.
While this is only what could be expected, it indicates both his
strength and limitation as a hymnwriter. He was above all the
sweet singer of Pietism.</p>
<p>The hymns of Brorson that appeared during his lifetime were
all written within the space of four years. In that brief period he
composed a volume of songs that rank with the finest in the Christian
church, and just as he might have been expected to produce
his finest work, he discontinued his effort. The hymns of the
<b>Swan-Song</b>&mdash;which we shall discuss later&mdash;though written for his
own edification, indicate what he might have attained if he had
continued to write for publication. His reason for thus putting
aside the lyre, which for a little while he had played so appealingly,
is unknown. Some have suggested that he wrote his hymns
according to a preconceived plan, which, when completed, he felt
no inclination to enlarge; others have surmised that the new and
ardent duties, bestowed upon him about this time, deprived him
of the leisure to write. But as Brorson himself expressed no reason
for his action, no one really knows why this sweet singer of Pietism
so suddenly ceased to sing.</p>

<div id="c10" title="Brorson&rsquo;s SWAN-SONG">
<h4>Chapter Ten
<span class="chaptertitle">Brorson&rsquo;s SWAN-SONG</span></h4>
<p>The Pietist movement, new and numerically small when
the Brorsons aligned themselves with it, made such sweeping
progress that within a few years it became the most powerful
movement within the Danish church. And in 1739, it ascended the
throne in the persons of King Christian VI and his consort, Queen
Sophia Magdalene of Kulmbach, an event of great significance to
the fortunes of the Brorsons.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_85">[85]</div>
<p>In Denmark the king is officially the head of the church. At
the time of Brorson all church appointments belonged to him, and
King Christian VI, if he had so wanted, could thus have filled all
vacancies with adherents of the movement in which he sincerely
believed. He was, however, no fanatic. Earnestly concerned, as
he no doubt was, to further the spiritual welfare of his subjects,
his only desire was to supply all church positions at his disposal
with good and able men. And as such the Brorsons were recommended
to him by his old tutor and adviser in church affairs,
John Herman Schraeder. On this recommendation, he successively
invited the brothers to preach at court. Their impression upon him
was so favorable that within a few years he appointed Nicolaj to
become pastor of Nicolaj church in Copenhagen, one of the largest
churches in the capital, Broder to become Provost of the cathedral
at Ribe and, two years later, Bishop of Aalborg, and Hans
Adolph to succeed his brother at Ribe and, four years later, to become
bishop of that large and historically famous bishopric. Thus
the brothers in a few years had been elevated from obscurity to
leading positions within their church.</p>
<p>Contemporaries express highly different estimates of Brorson
as a bishop. While praised by some, he is severely criticized by
others as unfit both by ability and temperament for the high office
he occupied. This last estimate now is generally held to be
unjust and, to some extent at least, inspired by jealousy of his quick
rise to fame and by antagonism to his pietistic views. A close
examination of church records and his official correspondence proves
him to have been both efficient in the administration of his office
and moderate in his dealings with others. He was by all accounts
an eloquent and effective speaker. Although Ribe was a small
city, its large cathedral was usually crowded whenever it was
known that Brorson would conduct the service. People came from
far away to hear him. And his preaching at home and on his frequent
visits to all parts of his large bishopric bore fruit in a signal
quickening of the Christian life in many of the parishes under his
charge. He was, we are told, as happy as a child when he found
pastors and their people working faithfully together for the upbuilding
of the kingdom. But his own zeal caused him to look
for the same earnestness in others. And he was usually stern and,
at times, implacable, in his judgment of neglect and slothfulness,
especially in the pastors.</p>
<p>His private life was by all accounts exceptionally pure and
<span class="pb" id="pg_86">[86]</span>
simple, a true expression of his sincere faith and earnest piety.
A domestic, who for many years served in his home has furnished
us with a most interesting account of his home life. Brorson, she
testifies, was an exceptionally kind and friendly man, always
gentle and considerate in his dealing with others except when
they had provoked him by some gross neglect or inattention to
right and duty. He was generous to a fault toward others, but
very frugal, even parsimonious in his home and in his personal
habits. Only at Christmas or on other special occasion would he
urge his household to spare nothing. He was a ceaseless and
industrious worker, giving close personal attention to the multiple
duties of his important position and office. His daily life bore
eloquent witness of his sincere piety. When at home, no matter
how busy, he always gathered his whole household for daily devotions.
Music constituted his sole diversion. He enjoyed an evening
spent in playing and singing with his family and servants. If
he chanced to hear a popular song with a pleasing tune, he often
adopted it to his own words, and sang it in the family circle. Many
of the hymns in his Swan-Song are said to have been composed
and sung in that way.</p>
<p>His life was rich in trials and suffering. His first wife died just
as he was preparing to go to Copenhagen for his consecration as
a bishop, and the loss affected him so deeply that only the pleading
of his friends prevented him from resigning the office. He
later married a most excellent woman, Johanne Riese, but could
never forget the wife of his youth. Several of his children preceded
him in death, some of them while still in their infancy, and others
in the prime of their youth. His own health was always delicate
and he passed through several severe illnesses from which his
recovery was considered miraculous. His heaviest cross was,
perhaps, the hopeless insanity of his first-born son, who throughout
his life had to be confined to a locked and barred room as a
hopeless and dangerous lunatic. A visitor in the bishop&rsquo;s palace,
it is related, once remarked: &ldquo;You speak so often about sorrows
and trials, Bishop Brorson, but you have your ample income and
live comfortably in this fine mansion, so how can you know about
these things?&rdquo; Without answering, Brorson beckoned his visitor
to follow him to the graveyard where he showed him the grave
of his wife and several of his children, and into the palace where
he showed him the sad spectacle of his insane son. Then the visitor
understood that position and material comfort are no guaranty
against sorrow.</p>

<p>A very sensitive man, Brorson was often deeply afflicted by
his trials, but though cast down, he was not downcast. The words
of his own beloved hymn, &ldquo;Whatever I am called to bear, I must
in patience suffer,&rdquo; no doubt express his own attitude toward
the burdens of his life. His trials engendered in him, however, an
intense yearning for release, especially during his later years. The
hymns of his <b>Swan-Song</b> are eloquent testimonies of his desire
to depart and be at home with God.</p>
<p>With the passing years his health became progressively poorer
and his weakening body less able to support the strain of his
exacting office. He would listen to no plea for relaxation, however,
until his decreasing strength clearly made it impossible for him
to continue. Even then he refused to rest and planned to publish
a series of weekly sermons that he might thus continue to speak
to his people. But his strength waned so quickly that he
was able to complete only one of the sermons.</p>
<p>On May 29, 1764, he begged a government official to complete
a case before him at his earliest convenience &ldquo;for I am now seventy
years old, feeble, bedridden and praying for release from this
unhappy world.&rdquo; Only a day later, his illness took a grave turn
for the worse. He sank into a stupor that lasted until dusk when
he awoke and said clearly, &ldquo;My Jesus is praying for me in heaven.
I see it by faith and am anxious to go. Come quickly, my Lord,
and take me home!&rdquo; He lingered until the morning of June 3, when
he passed away peacefully just as the great bells of the cathedral
announced the morning service.</p>
<p>Several fine memorials have been raised to his memory, among
them an excellent statue at the entrance to the cathedral at Ribe,
and a tablet on the inside wall of the building right beside a similar
remembrance of Hans Tausen, the leader of the Danish reformation
and a former bishop of the diocese. But the finest memorial
was raised to him by his son through the publication of <b>Hans
Adolph Brorson&rsquo;s Swan-Song</b>, a collection of hymns and songs
selected from his unpublished writings.</p>
<p>The songs of the <b>Swan-Song</b> were evidently written for the
poet&rsquo;s own consolation and diversion. They are of very different
types and merit, and a number of them might without loss have
been left out of the collection. A few of them stand unexcelled,
however, for beauty, sentiment and poetic excellence. There are
songs of patience such as the inimitable:</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_88">[88]</div>

<p class="t0">Her vil bies, o svage Sind.</p>

<p class="t0">Her vil bies, o svage Sind.</p>

<p>which one can hardly transfer to another language without
marring its tender beauty. And there are songs of yearning such
as the greatly favored,</p>

hymns, which Dr. Ryden, a Swedish-American Hymnologist,

<p>Brorson&rsquo;s hymns were received with immediate favor. <b>The
Rare Clenod of Faith</b> passed through six editions before the death
of its author, and a new church hymnal published in 1740 contained
ninety of his hymns. Pietism swept the country and adopted
Brorson as its poet. But its reign was surprisingly short. King
Christian VI died in 1746, and the new king, a luxury-loving
worldling, showed little interest in religion and none at all in Pietism.
Under his influence the movement quickly waned. During
the latter part of the eighteenth century it was overpowered by a
wave of religious rationalism which engulfed the greater part of
the intellectual classes and the younger clergy. The intelligentsia
adopted Voltaire and Rousseau as their prophets and talked
endlessly of the new age of enlightenment in which religion was
<span class="pb" id="pg_90">[90]</span>
to be shorn of its mysteries and people were to be delivered from
the bonds of superstition.</p>
<p>In such an atmosphere the old hymns and, least of all, Brorson&rsquo;s
hymns with their mystic contemplation of the Saviour&rsquo;s blood and
wounds could not survive. The leading spirits in the movement
demanded a new hymnal that expressed the spirit of the new age.
The preparation of such a book was undertaken by a committee
of popular writers, many of whom openly mocked Evangelical
Christianity. Their work was published under the title <b>The Evangelical
Christian Hymnal</b>, a peculiar name for a book which, as
has been justly said, was neither Evangelical nor Christian. The
compilers had eliminated many of the finest hymns of Kingo and
Brorson and ruthlessly altered others so that they were irrecognizable.
To compensate for this loss, a great number of &ldquo;poetically
perfect hymns&rdquo; by newer writers&mdash;nearly all of whom have happily
been forgotten&mdash;were adopted.</p>
<p>But while would-be leaders discarded or mutilated the old
hymns and, with a zeal worthy of a better cause, sought to force
their new songs upon the congregations, many of these clung
tenaciously to their old hymnal and stoutly refused to accept the
new. In places the controversy even developed into a singing
contest, with the congregations singing the numbers from the old
hymnal and the deacons from the new. And these contests were,
of course, expressive of an even greater controversy than the choice
of hymns. They represented the struggle between pastors, working
for the spread of the new gospel, and congregations still clinging
to the old. With the highest authorities actively supporting
the new movement, the result of the contest was, however, a foregone
conclusion. The new enlightenment triumphed, and thousands
of Evangelical Christians became homeless in their own
church.</p>
<p>During the subsequent period of triumphant Rationalism,
groups of Evangelical laymen began to hold private assemblies
in their own homes and to provide for their own spiritual nourishment
by reading Luther&rsquo;s sermons and singing the old hymns.
In these assemblies Brorson&rsquo;s hymns retained their favor until
a new Evangelical awakening during the middle part of the nineteenth
century produced a new appreciation of the old hymns and
restored them to their rightful place in the worship of the church.
And the songs of the Sweet Singer of Pietism have, perhaps,
never enjoyed a greater favor in his church than they do today.</p>

<h4>Chapter Eleven
<span class="chaptertitle">Grundtvig&rsquo;s Early Years</span></h4>
<p>The latter part of the eighteenth and the earlier part of
the nineteenth century produced a number of great changes
in the spiritual, intellectual and economic life of Denmark.
The strong Pietist movement at the time of Brorson, as we have
seen, lost much of its momentum with the death of King Christian
VI, and within a few years was overwhelmed by a wave of the
intellectual and religious Rationalism then engulfing a large part
of Europe. Religion, it was claimed, should be divested of its mysteries
and reason made supreme. Whatever could not justify itself
before the bar of the human intellect should be discarded as outworn
conceptions of a less enlightened age. The movement, however,
comprised all shades of opinions from pure agnosticism to
an idealistic belief in God, virtue and immortality.</p>
<p>Although firmly opposed by some of the most influential Danish
leaders of that day, such as the valiant bishop of Sj&aelig;lland, Johan
Edinger Balle, Rationalism swept the country with irresistible
force. Invested in the attractive robe of human enlightenment and
appealing to man&rsquo;s natural intellectual vanity, the movement attracted
the majority of the upper classes and a large proportion
of the clergy. Its adherents studied Rousseau and Voltaire, talked
resoundingly of human enlightenment, organized endless numbers
of clubs, and&mdash;in some instances&mdash;worked zealously for the social
and economic uplift of the depressed classes.</p>
<p>In this latter endeavor many pastors assumed a commendable
part. Having lost the old Gospel, the men of the cloth became
eager exponents of the &ldquo;social gospel&rdquo; of that day. While we may
not approve their Christmas sermons &ldquo;on improved methods of
stable feeding,&rdquo; or their Easter sermons &ldquo;on the profitable cultivation
of buckwheat,&rdquo; we cannot but recognize their devoted labor
for the educational and economic uplift, especially of the hard-pressed
peasants.</p>
<p>Their well-meant efforts, however, bore little fruit. The great
majority of the people had sunk into a slough of spiritual apathy
from which neither the work of the Rationalists nor the stirring
events of the time could arouse them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_94">[94]</div>
<p>The nineteenth century began threateningly for Denmark,
heaping calamity after calamity upon her. England attacked her
in 1801 and 1807, robbing her of her fine fleet and forcing her to
enter the European war on the side of Napoleon. The war wrecked
her trade, bankrupted her finances and ended with the severance
of her long union with Norway in 1814. But through it all Holger
Danske slept peacefully, apparently unaware that the very existence
of the nation was threatened.</p>
<p>It is against this background of spiritual and national indifference
that the towering figure of Grundtvig must be seen. For
it was he, more than any other, who awakened his people from their
lethargic indifference and started them upon the road toward a
happier day spiritually and nationally.</p>
<p>Nicolaj Frederik Severin Grundtvig, like so many of Denmark&rsquo;s
greatest men, was the son of a parson. He was born September
8, 1783, at Udby, a country parish in the south-eastern
part of Sj&aelig;lland. His father, Johan Ottesen Grundtvig, was a pastor
of the old school, an upright, earnest and staunch supporter
of the Evangelical Lutheran faith. His mother, Catherine Marie
Bang, was a high-minded, finely educated woman with an ardent
love for her country, its history, traditions and culture. Her son
claimed that he had inherited his love of &ldquo;song and saga&rdquo; from her.</p>
<p>The Grundtvigs on both sides of the family were descendants
of a long line of distinguished forebears, the most famous of
whom was Archbishop Absalon, the founder of Copenhagen and
one of the most powerful figures in 13th Century Denmark. And
they still had relatives in high places. Thus Johan Edinger Balle,
the formerly mentioned bishop of Sj&aelig;lland, was a brother-in-law
of Johan Grundtvig; Cathrine Grundtvig&rsquo;s brother, Dr. Johan Frederik
Bang, was a well-known professor of medicine and the stepfather
of Jacob Peter Mynster; and her younger sister, Susanna
Kristine Steffens, was the mother of Henrik Steffens, a professor at
the universities of Halle and Breslau, a friend of Goethe and
Schiller, and a leader of the early Romantic movement, both in
Germany and Denmark.</p>
<p>Cathrine Grundtvig bore her husband five children, of whom
Nicolaj was the youngest. But even with such a large household
to manage, she found time to supervise the early schooling of her
youngest son. She taught him to read, told him the sagas of his
people and gave him his first lessons in the history and literature,
both of his own and of other nations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_95">[95]</div>
<p>It was a period of stirring events. Wars and revolutions raged
in many parts of Europe. And these events were eagerly followed
and discussed in the parsonage. Listening to his elders, Grundtvig
saw, as it were, history in its making and acquired an interest in
the subject that produced rich fruits in later years. The wholesome
Christian life of his home and the devotional spirit of the services
in his father&rsquo;s church also made a deep impression upon him, an
impression that even the scepticism of his youth could not eradicate.</p>
<p>But his happy childhood years ended all too quickly. At the
age of nine he left his home to continue his studies under a former
tutor, Pastor L. Feld of Thyregod, a country parish in Jylland.
There he spent six lonely but quite fruitful years, receiving among
other things a solid training in the classical languages. In 1798, he
completed his studies with Rev. Feld and enrolled in the Latin
school at Aarhus, the principal city of Jylland. But the change
proved most unfortunate for young Grundtvig. Under the wise
and kindly guidance of Rev. Feld he had preserved the wholesome,
eager spirit of his childhood, but the lifeless teaching, the compulsory
religious exercises and the whole spiritless atmosphere of his
new school soon changed him into an indifferent, sophisticated and
self-satisfied cynic with little interest in his studies, and none at
all in religion.</p>
<p>At the completion of his course, however, this attitude did not
deter him from enrolling at the University of Copenhagen with the
intention of studying for the ministry. A university education was
then considered almost indispensable to a man of his social position,
and his parents earnestly wished him to enter the church. Nor
was his attitude toward Christianity greatly different from that of
his fellow students or even from that of many pastors already
preaching the emasculated gospel of God, Virtue, and Immortality
which the Rationalists held to be the true essence of the Christian
religion. Believing the important part of the Gospel to be its ethical
precepts, Grundtvig, furthermore, prided himself upon the correctness
of his own moral conduct and his ability to control all unworthy
passions. &ldquo;I was at that time,&rdquo; he later complained, &ldquo;nothing
but an insufferably vain and narrow-minded Pharisee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From this spirit of superior self-sufficiency, only two things
momentarily aroused him during his university years&mdash;the English
attacks upon Copenhagen; and a series of lectures by his cousin,
Henrik Steffens.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_96">[96]</div>
<p>Steffens, as a student at Jena, had met and become an enthusiastic
disciple of Schelling, the father of natural philosophy, a pantheistic
colored conception of life, opposed to the narrowly materialistic
views of most Rationalists. Lecturing at the university
during the years 1802-1803, Steffens aroused a tremendous enthusiasm,
both among the students and some of the older intellectuals.
&ldquo;He was a fiery speaker,&rdquo; Grundtvig remarks later, &ldquo;and his lectures
both shocked and inspired us although I often laughed at him
afterward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite his attempt to laugh away the impression of the fiery
speaker, Grundtvig, nevertheless, retained at least two lasting memories
from the lectures&mdash;the power of the spoken word, a power
that even against his will could arouse him from his cynical indifference,
and the reverence with which Steffens spoke of Christ as
&ldquo;the center of history.&rdquo; The human race, he contended, had sunk
progressively lower and lower from the fall of man until the time
of Nero, when the process had been reversed and man had begun
the slow upward climb that was still continuing. And of this progress
the speaker in glowing terms pictured Christ as the living center.</p>
<p>Grundtvig was graduated from the university in the spring of
1803. He wished to remain in Copenhagen but could find no employment
and was forced, therefore, to return to his home. Here
he remained for about a year, after which he succeeded in obtaining
a position as tutor for the son of Lieutenant Steensen Leth
of Egelykke, a large estate on the island of Langeland.</p>
<p>Except for the fact that Egelykke was far from Copenhagen,
Grundtvig soon became quite satisfied with his new position. Both
the manor and its surroundings were extremely beautiful, and his
work was congenial. His employer, a former naval officer, proved
to be a rough, hard-drinking worldling; but his hostess, Constance
Leth, was a charming, well-educated woman whose cultural interests
made the manor a favored gathering place for a group of
like-minded ladies from the neighborhood. And with these cultured
women, Grundtvig soon felt himself much more at home than
with his rough-spoken employer and hard-drinking companions.</p>
<p>But if Grundtvig unexpectedly was beginning to enjoy his stay
at Egelykke, this enjoyment vanished like a dream when he suddenly
discovered that he was falling passionately in love with his
attractive hostess. It availed him nothing that others as he well
knew might have accepted such a situation with complacence; to
<span class="pb" id="pg_97">[97]</span>
him it appeared an unpardonable reproach both to his intelligence
and his honor. Having proudly asserted the ability of any intelligent
man to master his passions, he was both horrified and humiliated
to discover that he could not control his own.</p>
<div class="img" title="Nicolaj Frederik Severin Grundtvig">
<img height="761" width="500" alt="Nicolaj Frederik Severin Grundtvig" src="images/grundtvg.png" />
<p class="center">Nicolaj Frederik Severin Grundtvig</p>
</div>
<p>Grundtvig never consciously revealed his true sentiment to
Constance Leth. At the cost of an intense struggle, he managed
outwardly to maintain his code of honorable conduct. But he still
felt humbled and shaken by his inability to suppress his inner and
as he saw it guilty passion. And under this blow to his proud self-sufficiency,
he felt, perhaps for the first time in his life, the need
for a power greater than his own. &ldquo;To win in this struggle,&rdquo; he
wrote in his diary, &ldquo;lies beyond my own power. I must look for
help from above or sink as the stone sinks while the lightly floating
leaves mock it and wonder why it cannot float as they do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The struggle against his passion engendered a need for work.
&ldquo;In order to quiet the storm within me,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;I forced my
mind to occupy itself with the most difficult labor.&rdquo; Although he
<span class="pb" id="pg_98">[98]</span>
had paid small attention to the suggestion at the time, he now remembered
and began to read some of the authors Steffens had
recommended in his lectures: Goethe, Schiller, Schelling, Fichte,
Shakespeare and others. He also studied the work of newer Danish
writers, such as Prof. Jens M&oslash;ller, a writer on Northern mythology,
and Adam Oehlenschlaeger, a young man who, inspired by Steffens,
was becoming the foremost dramatic poet of Denmark. He
even renewed the study of his long neglected Bible. The motive
of his extensive reading was, no doubt, ethical rather than esthetic,
a search for that outside power of which the battle within him revealed
his urgent need. Thus he wrote:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">My spirit opened its eyes,</p>
<p class="t0">Saw itself on the brink of the abyss,</p>
<p class="t0">Searched with trembling and fear</p>
<p class="t0">Everywhere for a power to save,</p>
<p class="t0">And found God in all things,</p>
<p class="t0">Found Him in the songs of the poets,</p>
<p class="t0">Found Him in the work of the sages,</p>
<p class="t0">Found Him in the myths of the North,</p>
<p class="t0">Found Him in the records of history,</p>
<p class="t0">But clearest of all it still</p>
<p class="t0">Found Him in the Book of Books.</p>
</div>
<p>The fate that appears to crush a man may also exalt him. And
so it was with Grundtvig. His suffering crushed the stony shell of
cynical indifference in which he had long enclosed his naturally
warm and impetuous spirit and released the great latent forces
within him. In the midst of his struggle, new ideas germinated
springlike in his mind. He read, thought and wrote, especially on
the subject that was always near to his heart, the mythology and
early traditions of the Northern peoples. And after three years of
struggle, he was at last ready to break away from Egelykke. If he
had not yet conquered his passion, he had so far mastered it that
he could aspire to other things.</p>
<p>Thus ended what a modern Danish writer, Skovgaard-Petersen,
calls &ldquo;the finest love story in Danish history.&rdquo; The event had
caused Grundtvig much pain, but it left no festering wounds. His
firm refusal to permit his passion to sully himself or degrade the
woman he loved had, on the contrary, made it one of the greatest
incitations to good in his whole life.</p>
<p>On his return to Copenhagen Grundtvig almost at once obtained
a position as teacher in history at Borch&rsquo;s Collegium for boys.
His new position satisfied him eminently by affording him a chance
<span class="pb" id="pg_99">[99]</span>
to work with his favorite subject and to expand his other intellectual
interests. He soon made friends with a number of promising
young intellectuals who, in turn, introduced him to some of the outstanding
intellectual and literary lights of the country, and within
a short while the list of his acquaintances read like a Blue Book of
the city&rsquo;s intelligentsia.</p>
<p>Although Grundtvig was still quite unknown except for a few
articles in a current magazine, there was something about him, an
originality of view, an arresting way of phrasing his thoughts, a
quiet sense of humor, that commanded attention. His young friends
willingly acknowledged his leadership, and the older watched him
with expectation. Nor were they disappointed. His <b>Northern Mythology</b>
appeared in 1808, and <b>Episodes from the Decay of Northern
Heroism</b> only a year later. And these strikingly original and finely
written works immediately established his reputation as one of
the foremost writers of Denmark. There were even those who in
their enthusiasm compared him with the revered Oehlenschlaeger.
A satirical poem, &ldquo;The Masquerade Ball of Denmark,&rdquo; inspired by
the frivolous indifference with which many people had reacted to
the English bombardment of Copenhagen in 1807, showed his power
of burning scorn and biting satire.</p>
<p>In the midst of this success and the preparation of plans for
new and more ambitious works, Grundtvig received a request from
his old father to come home and assist him with his parish work.
The request was not at all pleasing to him. His personal attitude
toward Christianity was still uncertain, and his removal from the
capital would interfere with his literary career. But as the wish
of his good parents could not be ignored, he reluctantly applied
for ordination and began to prepare his probation sermon.</p>
<p>This now famous sermon was delivered before the proper
officials March 17, 1810. Knowing that few besides the censors
would be present to hear him and feeling that an ordinary sermon
would be out of place before such an audience, Grundtvig prepared
his sermon as an historical survey of the present state of the church
rather than as an Evangelical discourse.</p>
<p>His study of history had convinced him of the mighty influence
Christianity had once exerted upon the nations, and he, therefore,
posed the question why this influence was now in decline. &ldquo;Are the
glad tidings,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;which through seventeen hundred years
passed from confessing lips to listening ears still not preached?&rdquo;
And the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. Even the very name of Jesus is now without
<span class="pb" id="pg_100">[100]</span>
significance and worth to most people of the younger generation,
&ldquo;for the Word of God has departed from His house and that
which is preached there is not the Word of God, but the earth-bound
speculations of men. The holy men of old believed in the
message they were called to preach, but the human spirit has now
become so proud that it feels itself capable of discovering the truth
without the light of the Gospel, and so faith has died. My Brethren!&rdquo;
he exclaims, &ldquo;Let us not, if we share this blindness and contempt
for the heavenly light, be false and shameless enough to desecrate
the Holy Place by appearing there as preachers of a Christianity in
which we ourselves do not believe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sermon was delivered with much force and eloquence.
Grundtvig felt himself stirred by the strength of his own argument;
and a comparison of the warm devotional spirit of a church service,
as he remembered it from his childhood, with the cold indifference
of later days moved him to sentimental tears, the first pious tears
that he had shed for many years, he said later. Even the censors
were so impressed that they unanimously awarded him the mark
of excellent, a generosity they bitterly regretted a few weeks later.
For Grundtvig, contrary to his promise&mdash;as the censors asserted
but Grundtvig denied&mdash;published his sermon. And it was warmly
received by the Evangelicals as the first manna that had fallen in
a desert for many years. But the Rationalists violently condemned
it and presented the Committee on Church Affairs with an indignant
protest against its author &ldquo;for having grossly insulted the
Danish clergy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Considering the enthusiastic approval the sermon had received
in various quarters, the committee would gladly have squashed the
complaint. But the complainers, comprising many of the most influential
pastors in the city, were too powerful to be ignored. And
so Grundtvig was found guilty &ldquo;of having willfully insulted the
Danish clergy, both individually and as a body,&rdquo; and sentenced to
receive a reprimand by the dean of the theological faculty.</p>
<p>When Grundtvig on January 11, 1811, presented himself before
the dean to receive his reprimand, he looked so pale and shaken
that even the worthy official took compassion upon him and advised
him privately that he must not take his sentence too seriously.
It was not, however, the stern reprimand of the dean but an experience
of far greater consequence that so visibly blanched the
cheeks of the defendant.</p>
<p>The prospect of entering the active ministry caused Grundtvig
<span class="pb" id="pg_101">[101]</span>
to examine seriously his own attitude toward Christianity. And
although the bishop vetoed his assignment to Udby and thus released
him from the immediate prospect of entering the pulpit,
this did not stop the trend of his thoughts. He had lost his former
indifference toward religion and discovered the historical significance
of Christianity, but just what did the Christian faith mean
to him personally?</p>
<p>He was still pondering this question, when in the fall of 1810,
he commenced a study of the Crusades, &ldquo;the heroic age of Christianity,&rdquo;
as one historian called the period. The phrase appealed
to him. He had lately wandered through the mystic halls of Northern
gods and heroes and deplored the decay of their heroic spirit.
He admired the heroic, and his heart still wavered between the
mighty Wodin and the meek and lowly Christ. But the heroic age
of Christianity&mdash;was it possible then that Christianity too could
rise to the heroic?</p>
<p>In the course of his study he read <b>The Early History of Prussia</b>
by A. von Kotzebue in which the author, after ridiculing &ldquo;the missionary
zeal that, like a fire on the steppes, caught the kings of
Poland and Scandinavia and moved them to frantic efforts for the
conversion of neighboring peoples,&rdquo; proudly stated, &ldquo;But while her
neighbors all accepted Christianity and the withered cross drew
steadily nearer to the green oak, Prussia remained faithful to her
ancient gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The withered Cross!&rdquo; The words stung Grundtvig to the
quick. He hurled the book away, sprang up and stormed about the
room, vowing that he would henceforth dedicate his life to the
cause of the spurned emblem.</p>
<p>A few weeks of restless exaltation followed. He read his Bible,
studied Luther&rsquo;s catechism and pondered the ways and means of
accomplishing a reform of his church, especially a reform inspired
by pen and ink. But his <b>New Year&rsquo;s Night</b>, a small book published
during this period, shows his still troublesome uncertainty, his constant
wavering between the old gods and the Christ of the Gospels,
between various degrees of Rationalism and a full acceptance of the
mystery of the cross. In a mighty hymn of praise to the suffering
Savior, he wrote many years later: &ldquo;Yes, my heart believes the
wonder of Thy cross, which ages ponder&rdquo;&mdash;but he had yet to pass
through the depths before he could say that. Even so, he now exultingly
wrote: &ldquo;On the rim of the bottomless abyss toward which
our age is blindly hastening, I will stand and confront it with a picture,
<span class="pb" id="pg_102">[102]</span>
illumined by two shining lights, the Word of God, and the
testimony of history. As long as God gives me strength to lift up
my voice, I will call and admonish my people in His name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But from this pinnacle of proud exultation, he was suddenly
hurled into the abyss when, like a bolt of lightning, the thought
struck him: But are you yourself a Christian, have you received
the forgiveness of your sin?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It struck me like a hammer, crashing the rock,&rdquo; he said later,
&ldquo;what the Lord tells the ungodly: &lsquo;What hast thou to declare my
statutes or that thou shouldest take my covenant into thy mouth,
seeing that thou hatest my instruction and castest my word behind
thee!&rsquo;&rdquo; Gone like a dream were now all his proud fancies. Only
one thought filled his whole being&mdash;to obtain the forgiveness of
his sin and the assurance of God&rsquo;s grace. But so violent became his
struggle that his mind at times reeled on the brink of insanity. His
young friends stood loyally by him, comforting and guarding him
as far as they could. And when it became clear that he must be
removed from the noise of the city, one of them, F. Sibbern, volunteered
to take him home. There his old parents received him
with understanding, even rejoicing that anxiety for his soul and
not other things had so disturbed his mind.</p>
<p>The peace of the quiet countryside, the understanding care of
his parents and the soothing influence of their firm Evangelical
faith acted as a balm to Grundtvig&rsquo;s struggling spirit. He loved to
enter the old church of his childhood, to hear his father preach, or
sit alone before the altar in meditation and prayer. And there before
the altar of the church in which he had been baptized and
confirmed, he at last found peace, the true peace of God that passeth
all understanding.</p>
<p>After the great change in his life, Grundtvig now wished most
heartily to become his father&rsquo;s assistant. The elder Grundtvig had
already forwarded his resignation from the pastorate but was more
than happy to apply for its return and for the appointment of his
son as his assistant. And so, Grundtvig was ordained at Copenhagen,
May 11, 1811, and installed at Udby a few days later. He
was back again in the old church of his childhood.</p>
</div>
<div id="c12" title="The Lonely Defender of the Bible">
<div class="pb" id="pg_103">[103]</div>
<h4>Chapter Twelve
<span class="chaptertitle">The Lonely Defender of the Bible</span></h4>
<p>Grundtvig began his work at Udby with all the zeal of a
new convert. He ministered to young and old, spent himself
in work for the sick and the poor, and preached the Gospel
with a fervor that was new, not only to the people of Udby, but to
most people of that generation. If other things had not intervened,
like his father, he might have spent his life as a successful country
pastor. But his father died January 5, 1813. The authorities refused
to confirm Grundtvig in the vacant charge, and he and his
mother, shortly afterward, were compelled to leave the parsonage
that had been their home for more than forty years. His mother
settled in Prast&oslash;, a small city a few miles from Udby, and Grundtvig
returned to Copenhagen to search for a new position, a task
that this time proved both long and painful.</p>
<p>Among available positions, Grundtvig especially coveted a professorship
in history at the newly founded university of Oslo, Norway,
at which three of his friends, S. B. Hersleb, Niels Trechow
and George Sverdrup, had already obtained employment. But although
these friends worked zealously for his appointment, even
after the separation of Norway from Denmark, their efforts were
fruitless. Grundtvig was not destined to leave his native land.
Nor were his attempts to secure other work successful. In spite of
the fact that he applied for almost every vacancy in the church,
even the smallest, his powerful enemies among the Rationalists
were influential enough to prevent his appointment to any of them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he was by no means idle. Following his conversion,
he felt for a time like a man suddenly emerging from darkness into
the brightness of a new day. Old things had passed away, but the
brilliance of the new light confused him. What could he do? How
many of his former interests were reconcilable with his new views?
Could he, for instance, continue his writings? &ldquo;When my eyes were
opened,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;I considered all things not directly concerned
with God a hindrance to the blessed knowledge of my Lord, Jesus
Christ.&rdquo; After a time he saw, however, that his ability to write
might be accepted as a gift from God to be used in His service.
&ldquo;The poet when inspired,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;may proclaim a message from
<span class="pb" id="pg_104">[104]</span>
above to the world below,&rdquo; and so, &ldquo;after dedicating it to Himself,
the Lord again handed me the harp that I had placed upon His
altar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During his brief stay at Udby, Grundtvig published three
larger works: <b>Episodes from the Battle between Ases and Norns</b>,
<b>Saga</b> and <b>A New Year&rsquo;s Gift for 1812</b>.<sup><a id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a></sup>
The first of these was nearly
completed before his conversion, and as he now reread the manuscript,
its content almost shocked him. Was it possible that he had
felt and written thus only a few months ago! He thought of destroying
the work but decided to recast it in conformity with his
present views and to express these clearly in a preface. With the
completion of this task, however, he took a long leave from the
&ldquo;ice-cold giants of the North&rdquo; that had so long engrossed his attention.</p>
<p>After his brief visit with the heroes of the past, Grundtvig
again turned his attention to their descendants in the present. And
the contrast was almost startling. The war still was dragging on
and the country sinking deeper and deeper into the morass of
political, commercial and economic difficulties. But the majority
of the people seemed completely indifferent to her plight. &ldquo;They
talked of nothing,&rdquo; Grundtvig says, &ldquo;but of what they had eaten,
worn and amused themselves with yesterday, or what they would
eat, wear and amuse themselves with tomorrow.&rdquo; Was it possible
that these people could be descendants of the giants whose valor
and aggressive spirit had once challenged the greater part of
Europe?</p>
<p>Grundtvig was convinced that the spiritual apathy of his people
resulted from the failure of their spiritual leaders to uphold the
Evangelical faith, and that the salvation of the nation depended on
a true revival of Evangelical Christianity. For this reason he now
exerted every means at his command to induce the people and,
especially, their leaders to return to the old paths. In numerous
works, both in verse and in prose, he urged the people to renew
the faith of their fathers and challenged their leaders to take a
definite stand for Biblical Christianity. He became the lonely
defender of the Bible.</p>
<p>Among outstanding personalities of that day, there were especially
two that attracted widespread attention: J. P. Mynster,
assistant pastor at the Church of Our Lady in Copenhagen, and
Adam Gottlieb Oehlenschlaeger, the dramatic poet, then at the
height of his fame. With their influence these men, as Grundtvig
<span class="pb" id="pg_105">[105]</span>
saw it, might give a strong impetus to the much needed awakening;
and, he therefore, approached them personally.</p>
<p>Rev. Mynster, a stepson of Grundtvig&rsquo;s maternal uncle, after
a period of rationalism, had experienced a quiet conversion to
Evangelical faith and won a respected name as a faithful and gifted
preacher of the Gospel, a name which he retained throughout his
conspicuous career as pastor of the Church of Our Lady in Copenhagen
and, later, as Bishop of Sj&aelig;lland. He and Grundtvig, working
to the same purpose, ought to have united with another, but
they were both too individualistic in temperament and views to
join forces. Mynster was coldly logical, calm and reserved, a lover
of form and orderly progress. Grundtvig was impetuous, and volcanic,
in constant ferment, always in search of spiritual reality
and wholly indifferent to outward appearances. His own experience
had led him to believe that a return to Evangelical Christianity
could be effected only through a clean break with Rationalism, and
he could not understand Mynster&rsquo;s apparent attempt to temporize
and bring about a gradual transition from one to the other. There
should be no compromise between truth and falsehood. All believers
in the Gospel should stand up and proclaim it fearlessly,
no matter what the consequences.</p>
<p>And so Grundtvig wrote to Mynster: &ldquo;Dear Rev. Mynster, I
owe you an apology for asking a question that in our days may appear
inexcusable: What is your real belief regarding the Bible and
the faith of Jesus Christ? If you humbly believe in God&rsquo;s Word,
I shall rejoice with you even if you differ with me in all other
things. Dear Rev. Mynster&mdash;for you are that to me&mdash;if my question
appears unseemly, you must not let it hurt you, for I have
written only as my heart dictates.&rdquo; But Mynster did feel offended
and answered Grundtvig very coldly that his questions implied an
unwarranted and offensive doubt of his sincerity that must make
future intercourse between them difficult&mdash;if not impossible.</p>
<p>Nor was Grundtvig more successful with a letter of similar
purport to Oehlenschlaeger whose later writings he found lacked
the spiritual sincerity of his earlier work. &ldquo;My concern about this,&rdquo;
he wrote, &ldquo;is increased by the thought that this lessening of spirituality
must be expressive of a change in your own spiritual outlook,
your inner relationship with God whom all spiritual workers should
serve, counting it a greater achievement to inspire their fellow men
with a true adoration of our Lord than to win the acclaim of the
world.&rdquo; But like Mynster the highly feted poet accepted this frank
<span class="pb" id="pg_106">[106]</span>
questioning of his inner motive as an unwarranted impertinence,
the stupid intrusion of an intolerable fanatic with whom no friend
of true enlightenment could have anything to do. Grundtvig was
fast finding out what it means to be counted a fool for Christ&rsquo;s sake&mdash;or
for what he thought was Christ&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>In the midst of these troubles Grundtvig again turned his attention
to history, his favorite subject from childhood days. His
retreat from the present to the past implied no abolition, however,
of his resolve to dedicate himself to a spiritual revival of his people.
Through his historical work he wished to show the influence
of Christianity upon the people of Europe. &ldquo;That the life of every
people,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;is and must be a fruit of faith should be clear
to all. For who can dispute that every human action&mdash;irrespective
of how little considered it may have been&mdash;is expressive of its doer&rsquo;s
attitude, of his way of feeling and thinking. But what determines
a man&rsquo;s way of thinking except his essential thoughts concerning
the relationship between God and the world, the visible
and the invisible? Every serious thinker, therefore, must recognize
the importance of faith in the furtherance of science, the progress
of nations and the life of the state. It is a fearful delusion that
man can be immoral, an unbeliever, even an enemy of the cross
of Christ, and yet a furtherer of morality and science, a good neighbor
and a benefactor to his country.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>A Brief Survey of the World&rsquo;s History</b>, which Grundtvig published
in 1812, is thus the opposite of an objective presentation of
historical events. It is a Christian philosophy of history, an attempt
to prove the truth of the Gospel by its effect upon the nations.
With the Bible before him Grundtvig weighs and evaluates
people and events upon the scale of the revealed word. And his
judgment is often relentless, stripping both persons and events of
the glorified robes in which history and traditions invested them.
In answer to countless protests against such a method of reading
history, Grundtvig contends that the Christian historian must accept
the consequences of his faith. He cannot profess the truth of
Christianity and ignore its implication in the life of the world. If
the Gospel be true, history must be measured by its relation to its
truth.</p>
<p>Grundtvig&rsquo;s history caused a sensation, especially on account
of its frank appraisal of many well-known persons. Nearly all
praised its lucid style; a few, such as George Sverdrup, spoke highly
of its strikingly original estimate and correlation of events; but the
<span class="pb" id="pg_107">[107]</span>
intelligentsia condemned it as the work of an impossible fanatic.
With this work, they claimed, Grundtvig had clearly removed himself
from the pale of intelligent men.</p>
<p>But while his enemies raged, Grundtvig was already busy
with another work: <b>A Brief Account of God&rsquo;s Way with the Danish
and Norwegian Peoples</b>. This history which, written in verse and
later published under the title of <b>Roskilde Rhymes</b>, was first read
at a diocesan convention in Roskilde Cathedral, the Westminster
Abbey of Denmark. Although the poem contained many urgent
calls to the assembled pastors to awake and return to the way of
the fathers, whose bones rested within the walls of the historic
sanctuary, its reading caused no immediate resentment. Most of
the reverend listeners are reported, in fact, to have been peacefully
asleep when late in the evening Grundtvig finished the reading of
his lengthy manuscript. But a paper on &ldquo;Polemics and Tolerance&rdquo;
which he read at another convention two years later kept his listeners
wide awake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our day has inherited two shibboleths from the eighteenth
century: enlightenment and tolerance. By the last of these words
most people understand an attitude of superior neutrality toward
the opinions of others, even when these opinions concern the highest
spiritual welfare of man. Such an attitude has for its premise
that good and evil, truth and falsehood are not separate and irreconcilable
realities but only different phases of the same question.
But every Christian, thoroughly convinced of the antagonism
and irreconcilability of truth with falsehood, must inevitably hate
and reject such a supposition. If Christianity be true, tolerance toward
opinions and teachings denying its truth is nothing but a
craven betrayal of both God and man. It is written, &lsquo;Judge and
condemn no one&rsquo; but not &lsquo;Judge and condemn nothing.&rsquo; For every
Christian must surely both judge and condemn evil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are times when to fight for Christianity may not be an
urgent necessity; but that cannot be so in our days when every one
of its divine truths is mocked and assailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You call me a self-seeking fanatic, but if I be that, why are
you yourself silent? If I be misleading those who follow me, why
are you, the true watchmen of Zion, not exerting yourself to lead
them aright? I stand here the humblest of Danish pastors, a minister
without a pulpit, a man reviled by the world, shorn of my
reputation as a writer, and held to be devoid of all intelligence and
truth. Even so I solemnly declare that the religion now preached
<span class="pb" id="pg_108">[108]</span>
in our Danish church is not Christianity, is nothing but a tissue of
deception and falsehood, and that unless Danish pastors bestir
themselves and fight for the restoration of God&rsquo;s word and the
Christian faith there will soon be no Christian church in Denmark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The immediate effect of this bold challenge was a stern reprimand
from Bishop Frederik Munter, accompanied by a solemn
warning that if he ever again ventured to voice a similar judgment
upon his fellow pastors, sterner measures would at once be taken
against him. Besides this, his enemies raved, some of his few remaining
friends broke with him, and H. C. &Oslash;rsted, the famous discoverer
of electro-magnetism, continued an attack upon him that
for bitterness has no counterpart in Danish letters. In the midst
of this storm Grundtvig remained self-possessed, answering his
critic quite calmly and even with a touch of humor. Although relentless
in a fight for principles, he was never vindictive toward his
personal enemies. In 1815, he published a collection of poems,
<b>Kvaedlinger</b>, in which he asks, &ldquo;Who knoweth of peace who never
has fought, whoso has been saved and suffered naught?&rdquo; And
these lines no doubt express his personal attitude toward the battles
of life.</p>
<p>Being without a pulpit of his own, Grundtvig, after his return
to Copenhagen, frequently accepted invitations to preach for other
pastors. But as the opposition against him grew, these invitations
decreased and, after the Roskilde affair, only one church, the church
of Frederiksberg, was still open to him. Grundtvig felt his exclusion
very keenly, but he knew that even friendly pastors hesitated
to invite him for fear of incurring the disapproval of superiors
or the displeasure of influential parishioners. And so, at
the close of a Christmas service in the Frederiksberg church in
1815, he solemnly announced that he would not enter a pulpit
again until he had been duly appointed to do so by the proper
authorities.</p>
<p>Grundtvig&rsquo;s withdrawal from the church, though pleasing to
his active enemies, was a great disappointment to his friends. His
services had always been well attended, and his earnest message
had brought comfort to many, especially among the distressed
Evangelicals. But others, too, felt the power of his word. Thus a
man in Copenhagen, after attending one of his services, wrote to a
friend, &ldquo;that he had laughed at the beginning of the sermon and
wept at its conclusion&rdquo; and that &ldquo;it was the only earnest testimony
<span class="pb" id="pg_109">[109]</span>
he had ever heard from a pulpit.&rdquo; And a reporter writing to a
Copenhagen newspaper about his last service said, &ldquo;Our famous
Grundtvig preached yesterday at Frederiksberg church to such a
crowd of people that the church was much too small to accommodate
them. Here were people from all walks of life, and the speaker,
we are convinced, stirred them to the bottom of their souls. Here
was a Mynster&rsquo;s clarity, a Fallesen&rsquo;s earnestness, and a Balle&rsquo;s appeal
united with a Nordahl Brun&rsquo;s manliness and admirable language.&rdquo;
And this about a man for whom his church had no room!</p>
<p>Thus Grundtvig instead of the friendly co-operation he had
hoped for especially from the spiritual and intellectual leaders of
the people found himself virtually shut out from the circle to which
he naturally belonged, and from the church he loved, perhaps better
than any man of his generation.</p>
<p>But if his hope of enlisting the leaders in a campaign to revive
the spiritual life of the common people had been disappointed, his
own determination to devote his life to that purpose remained unshaken.
If he could look for no help from the recognized leaders
of his nation, he must somehow gain a hearing from the common
people themselves. His personal contact with these, however, was
rather slight. Except for his brief work as a pastor, he had so far
spent the greater part of his life in intellectual pursuits quite removed
from the interest of the common man. And the question was
then how he, a man without any special position and influence,
could reach the ears of his countrymen.</p>
<p>In searching for an answer to this question, he remembered
the two things that most profoundly had influenced his own spiritual
outlook, his study of the traditions and history of his people,
and his religious awakening in 1810. Was it not possible then that
a like change might be engendered in others by presenting them
with a picture of their own glorious past or, as his friend Ingemann
later expressed it, by calling forth the generations that died to testify
against the generation that lived? In presenting such a picture
he would not have to rely on his own inventiveness but could use
material already existing, foremost among which were the famous
<b>Sagas of Norwegian Kings</b> by Snorra Sturlason, and <b>Denmark&rsquo;s
Chronicle</b> by Saxo Grammaticus, the former written in Icelandic,
and the latter in Latin.</p>
<p>When Grundtvig presented this plan to his remaining friends,
they received it at once with enthusiasm and began the organization
<span class="pb" id="pg_110">[110]</span>
of societies both in Denmark and Norway for the purpose of
sponsoring its execution, in itself a most herculean task.</p>
<p>The two books contain together about fifteen hundred large
and closely printed pages and present a circumstantial account of
the early mythological and factual history of the two nations. Even
a merely literal translation of them might well consume years of
labor. But Grundtvig&rsquo;s plan went much farther than mere literal
translation. Wishing to appeal to the common people, he purposed
to popularize the books and to transcribe them in a purer and more
idiomatic Danish than the accepted literary language of the day, a
Danish to be based on the dialects of the common people, the folk-songs,
popular proverbs, and the old hymns. It was a bold undertaking,
comparable to the work of Luther in modelling the language
of the German Bible after the speech of the man in the street
and the mother at the cradle, or to the great effort of Norway in our
days to supplant the Danish-Norwegian tongue with a language from
the various dialects of her people. Nor can it be said that Grundtvig
was immediately successful in his attempt. His version of the
sagas sounds somewhat stilted and artificial, and it never became
popular among the common people for whom it was especially intended.
Eventually, however, he did develop his new style into a
plain, forceful mode of expression that has greatly enriched the
Danish language of today.</p>
<p>For seven years Grundtvig buried himself in &ldquo;the giant&rsquo;s
mount,&rdquo; emerging only occasionally for the pursuit of various
studies in connection with his work or to voice his views on certain
issues that particularly interested him. He discovered a number of
errors in the Icelandic version of Beowulf and made a new Danish
translation of that important work; he engaged in a bitter literary
battle with Paul Mueller, a leader among the younger academicians,
in defence of the celebrated lyric poet, Jens Baggesen, who had
aroused the wrath of the students by criticising their revered dramatist,
Oehlenschlaeger; and he fought a furious contest with the
greatly admired song and comedy writer, John L. Heiberg, in defence
of his good friend, Bernhard Severin Ingemann, whose excellent
but overly sentimental lyrics had invited the barbed wit of
the humorist. But although Grundtvig&rsquo;s contributions to these disputes
were both able and pointed, their main effect was to widen
the breach between him and the already antagonistic intellectuals.</p>
<p>In 1817 Grundtvig published the second part of <b>World Chronicles</b>,
and a few issues of a short-lived periodical entitled &ldquo;Dannevirke&rdquo;
which among other excellent contributions presented his
<span class="pb" id="pg_111">[111]</span>
splendid poem, &ldquo;The Easter Lily,&rdquo; a poetic dramatization of our
Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, about which the poet, Baggesen, said that &ldquo;it
outweighed all Oehlenschlaeger&rsquo;s tragedies and that he himself
had moments when he would rather have been the author of this
incomparably beautiful poem than of everything he himself had
written.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grundtvig began his translation of the sagas on a wave of high
enthusiasm. But as the years multiplied, the interest of his supporters
waned and he himself wearied of the task. He began, besides,
to doubt his ability to resurrect the heroic dead in such a
manner that they could revive the dropping spirit of the living.</p>
<p>In a welcome to Ingemann, on his return from a tour abroad,
he expresses the hope that the poet will now devote his gifts to a
reincarnation of his country&rsquo;s old heroes. He himself has tried to
do this. &ldquo;He has made armor, shields and swords for them of saga&rsquo;s
steel, and borrowed horses for them from the ancient bards, but he
has no cloth fit for the coats of such elegant knights nor feathers
beautiful enough to adorn their helmets. He can sound a challenge
but has no voice for singing; he can ring a bell but can not play
the lute.&rdquo; In other words, he can depict the thoughts and ideals of
the old heroes but lacks the poetical ability to recreate them as
living personalities&mdash;a remarkably true estimate of his own limitations.</p>
<p>The discovery that his translation of the sagas was not accomplishing
its intended purpose, and a growing apprehension that the
written word was, perhaps, impotent to revive the spiritual life of
his people, engendered in him an increasing wish to leave &ldquo;the
mount of the dead&rdquo; and re-enter the world of the living. His economic
circumstances also necessitated a change. In 1818 he had married
Elizabeth Blicher, the daughter of a brother pastor, and he
found it well nigh impossible to support his wife and growing family
on the meager returns from his writings and a small pension
which the government allowed him for his work with the sagas.</p>
<p>Spurred by these reasons, he applied for almost every vacancy
in the church, even the smallest, and, in 1821, succeeded in obtaining
an appointment to the pastorate at Prast&oslash;, a small city on the
south-eastern shores of Sj&aelig;lland.</p>
<p>Grundtvig was well satisfied with his new charge. He was
kindly received by his congregation; the city was quite close to his
beloved Udby, and his mother still lived there. &ldquo;In the loveliest
surroundings my eyes have ever seen and among a friendly people,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="pg_112">[112]</span>
he writes, &ldquo;my strength soon revived so that I could continue
my literary work and even complete my wearisome translation of
the sagas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An incident is related from his work at Prast&oslash; which throws a
somewhat revealing light upon his ability as a pastor. At his only
confirmation service there, the confirmants, we are told, wept so
that he had to pause several times in his address to them in order
to let them regain their composure. Since he was always quite
objective in his preaching and heartily disbelieved in the usual revival
methods, the incident illustrates his rare ability to profoundly
stir even the less mature of his hearers by his objective presentation
of the Gospel. Even his bitterest enemies could not deny the evident
effectiveness of his ministry in every charge he served.</p>
<p>His work at Prast&oslash; was, however, of brief duration. In 1822,
less than two years after his installation, he received and accepted
a call as assistant pastor at Our Savior&rsquo;s Church in Copenhagen,
thus attaining his long deferred wish for a pulpit in the capital.</p>

<span class="chaptertitle">The Living Word</span></h4>
<p>Grundtvig began his ministry in the capital with high hopes,
but he was soon disappointed. His services as usual attracted
large audiences, audiences that frequently overflowed the
spacious sanctuary. But these came from all parts of the city, an
ever changing throng from which it was quite impossible to create
a real congregation. The parish itself was so large that the mere
routine duties of his office consumed much of his time. There were
mass weddings, mass baptisms, mass funerals for people of whom
he knew little and could have no assurance that he was not &ldquo;giving
the holy unto dogs or casting pearls before swine.&rdquo; With the prevailing
decay of church-life most pastors accepted these conditions
with equanimity, but to Grundtvig they constituted an increasingly
heavy burden.</p>
<p>He was still lonely. Awakened Christians were few, and his
<span class="pb" id="pg_113">[113]</span>
fellow pastors were nearly all Rationalists who looked upon him
as a dangerous fanatic whom it was best to avoid. Grundtvig&rsquo;s
opinion about them, though different, was scarcely higher. It provoked
him to observe pastors openly repudiating doctrines and
ordinances which they had sworn to defend. To his mind such a
course was both dishonorable to themselves and unjust toward
their congregations which, whether or not they approved of these
unlawful acts, had to be served by their parish pastors. The majority,
it is true, accepted the new doctrines with indifference. Rationalism
then as now promoted apathy rather than heresy. But
Grundtvig observed its blighting effect everywhere, even upon
himself.</p>
<p>Signs of a new awakening, nevertheless, were appearing here
and there, especially in certain rural communities. Influenced by
the Haugean movement in Norway and Grundtvig&rsquo;s own earlier
work, scattering groups of Evangelicals and Pietists began to
evince new life and activity. Peasants in a number of parishes in
Jutland refused to accept the Evangelical Christian hymnal and
a new rationalistic colored catechism, choosing to go to jail rather
than to compromise their faith; and groups of Evangelical laymen
on the island of Fyn began to hold private assemblies at which
they nourished themselves by reading Luther&rsquo;s sermons and singing
Kingo&rsquo;s and Brorson&rsquo;s hymns. Most if not all of these groups
admired Grundtvig for his bold defiance of Biblical Christianity
and looked hopefully to him for encouragement. If, as his enemies
charged, he had wished to make himself the head of a party, he
could easily have done so by assuming the leadership of the private
assemblies.</p>
<p>But Grundtvig never compromised his views for the sake of
attracting a following, and he did not approve of private assemblies.
Such groups, he wrote, had frequently disrupted the church,
bred contempt for Scripture, and fostered a perverted form of
piety. Even as a release from the present deplorable situation, they
might easily produce more harm than good.</p>
<p>Although Grundtvig could not approve of the assemblies he,
nevertheless, sympathized deeply with the distressed laity. A layman
was then bound to his parish, and Grundtvig clearly understood
the difficulty of laymen who had to accept the ministry,
have their children baptized, instructed and confirmed by pastors
denying fundamental doctrines of their faith. With his usual frankness
he therefore threw caution to the winds and reminded the
<span class="pb" id="pg_114">[114]</span>
pastors that it was their own failure to preach and defend the Lutheran
faith that was forcing Evangelical laymen to seek in the
assemblies what was arbitrarily withheld from them in the church.
&ldquo;Whether it be good or bad, recommendable or deplorable,&rdquo;
Grundtvig wrote, &ldquo;it is, at any rate, a fact that the spirit of the
church service has changed so greatly during the last half century
that it is almost impossible for an Evangelical Christian to derive
any benefit from it, and it is this situation that has forced earnest
laymen to invent such a substitute for the church as the private
assemblies evidently are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a number of years Grundtvig thought and wrote almost
ceaselessly about this problem. With conditions so perverted that
the lawbreakers were imprisoning the victims of their own lawlessness,
something ought evidently to be done about it. But what
could he do?</p>
<p>He tried to attack Rationalism from new angles. In a carefully
written article in &ldquo;The Theological Monthly,&rdquo; a magazine
that he published in collaboration with the learned but crusty Dr.
G. A. Rudelbach, he argued that any inquiry concerning the nature
of Christianity should distinguish between the questions:
What is true Christianity? and Is Christianity True? The first was
a historical question, and could be answered only by an examination
of the original teachings of Christianity; the second was a question
of conscience and depended on the attitude of the individual. He was
he asserted, perfectly willing to recognize the right of the Rationalists
to believe what ever they choose, but as a historian he had to
protest against the propagation of any belief under the name of
Christianity that clearly denied what Christianity originally affirmed.</p>
<p>His writing, however, produced no evident result. The rationalists
either maintained a contemptuous silence or answered him
by their favorite cry of ignorance and fanaticism. The true teachings
of Christianity, they asserted, could be ascertained only by
the trained theologian, able to read the Bible in the original and
trained to interpret it in the light of current knowledge. Such men
knew, it was claimed, that many of the doctrines formerly held by
the church, such as the divinity of Christ, the atonement and the
triunity of God, were not found in the Scriptures at all or were
based on misread or misinterpreted texts.</p>
<p>Although these contentions were almost as old as Christianity
itself, Grundtvig still found that a clear refutation of them was practically
<span class="pb" id="pg_115">[115]</span>
impossible. He could not disprove them by Scripture, for
the Rationalists would claim their interpretation of the Bible to
be as trustworthy as his own; nor could he appeal to the confessions,
for his opponents openly repudiated these as antiquated conceptions
of a less enlightened age. His only hope of giving any real
guidance to the confused and distressed laity of his church thus
appeared to depend on the possibility of discovering an expression
of Christianity so authoritative that the most learned perverter of
the faith could not repudiate it and so plain that the humblest believer
could understand it. In his anxiety it even seemed to him
that the Lord had failed adequately to provide for His little ones
if He had not supplied them with such a shield against the storm of
confusing doctrines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being greatly distressed with the thought that all humble
Christians must either fall into doubt concerning their only Savior
and His Gospel or build their faith on the contradictory teachings
of learned theologians,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;I perceived clearly the pressing
need of the church for a simpler, more dependable and authoritative
statement of that word of God which shall never pass away
than all the book-worms of the world could ever produce. But
while my anxiety for the distressed laity of my church grew and
I sought night and day for a clear testimony of Jesus that would
enable them to try the spirits whether they be of God, a good
angel whispered to me: &lsquo;Why seekest thou the living among the
dead?&rsquo; Then the scales fell from my eyes, and I saw clearly that
the word of God which I so anxiously sought could be no other
than that which at all times, in all churches and by all Christians
has been accepted as a true expression of their faith and the covenant
of their baptism, the Apostolic Creed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his search for an effective means of arming the laity against
the confusing claims of the Rationalists, Grundtvig thus came to
place the Creed above the Bible, or rather to assert that the two
should stand side by side, and that all explanations of the latter
should agree with the plain articles of the former so that every
Christian personally could weigh the truth or error of what was
taught by comparing it with his baptismal covenant.</p>
<p>Grundtvig supported his &ldquo;great discovery&rdquo; with passages from
the Bible and the church fathers, especially Irenaeus. He advanced
the theory that Jesus had taught the Creed to His disciples during
the forty days after His resurrection in which He remained with
them, &ldquo;speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God&rdquo;;
<span class="pb" id="pg_116">[116]</span>
that the Creed through the early centuries had been regarded as
too sacred to commit to writing and, therefore had been transmitted
orally; and that it constituted, together with the words of institution
of the sacraments and the Lord&rsquo;s prayer, in a special sense
&ldquo;the living word of God&rdquo; by which He builds and vivifies His
church. It should be stated, however, that Grundtvig&rsquo;s intention
by distinguishing between what he called &ldquo;the living&rdquo; and &ldquo;the
written word,&rdquo; was not to belittle the Bible but only to define its
proper place, the place of enlightening and guiding those, who
through God&rsquo;s living covenant with them in their baptism already
have become Christians. A Christian, he believed, is reborn in his
baptism, nourished in the Communion and enlightened by the
Word.</p>
<p>A critical examination of Grundtvig&rsquo;s theory, about which
thousands of pages have been written, lies beyond the scope of
this work. Grundtvig himself felt that his &ldquo;discovery&rdquo; had given
him a solid foundation for his stand against the Rationalists. And
his theory unquestionably did enable him, in the midst of an almost
hopeless religious confusion, to reassert the essentials of Evangelical
Christianity, to refute the contentions of the Rationalists by
weighing them on an acknowledged historical basis of faith, and to
reemphasize that the Christian church is not a creation of theological
speculations but of God&rsquo;s own work in His word and sacraments.</p>
<p>Grundtvig for some time previous to his discovery had felt exceedingly
depressed. His long struggle for the reawakening of his
people to a richer Christian and national life appeared fruitless.
Most of the intellectual and spiritual leaders of his time looked
upon the very idea of sharing the richer cultural and spiritual
values of life with the common man as a visionary conception of
an unstable and erratic mind. One ought naturally, they admitted,
to be interested in improving the social and economic conditions
of the lower classes, but the higher treasures of mind and spirit
belonged in the very nature of things to the cultured few and could
not be shared with the common herd.</p>
<p>In spite of these discouragements, Grundtvig somehow experienced
a wonderful rebirth of his hope in the spring of 1824, an
experience to which he gave eloquent expression in his great poem,
&ldquo;New Year&rsquo;s Morning.&rdquo; He writes in the preface that he has &ldquo;long
enough battled with a witch called indifference, and has discovered
that the battle wherein one is most likely to be defeated is
<span class="pb" id="pg_117">[117]</span>
the battle against nothing.&rdquo; He therefore urges his friends to ignore
the witch and join him in a determined crusade for a reawakening
of the Northern spirit to the accomplishment of Christian deed.</p>
<p>Grundtvig&rsquo;s hope for a season of quiet and peaceful cooperation
with his friends was, however, soon shattered. In the summer
of 1825, a young professor of theology, H. N. Clausen, published
a book entitled: <b>The Constitution, Doctrine and Rituals of Catholicism
and Protestantism</b>. As Prof. Clausen enjoyed a great popularity
among his students and, as a teacher of theology, might influence
the course of the Danish church for many years, Grundtvig was
very much interested in what he had to say. He obtained the book
and read it quickly but thoughtfully, underscoring the points with
which he disagreed. And these were numerous. At the very beginning
of the book, he found the author asserting that &ldquo;the Protestant
theologian, since he need recognize no restriction of his interpretations
by creeds, traditions, or ecclesiastical authorities, is
as once infinitely more free and important than his Catholic colleague.
For as the Protestant church unlike the Catholic possesses
no conclusive and authoritative system of belief either in her creeds
or in Scripture, it devolves upon her trained theologians to set
forth what the true teachings of Christianity really are. &ldquo;Why, O
why!&rdquo; the professor exclaims, &ldquo;should eternal Wisdom have willed
revelation to appear in a form so imperfect? What other purpose,
I ask you, can an all-wise Providence have had with such a plan
than to compel the children of man to recognize that it is only
through the exercise of their own, human intelligence that the
revelation of God can be comprehended!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Grundtvig mused upon these assertions so expressive of
all that he had denied and fought against, he felt at once that they
constituted a challenge which he could not leave unanswered. He
had shortly before written to a friend: &ldquo;Since the perverters of
Christianity have become so self-confident that they will not answer
any charge against them except when it is addressed to themselves
personally and by name, one may eventually have to employ
that form of attack.&rdquo; And that was the form he chose to use in his
now famous book. <b>The Reply of the Church to Prof. H. N. Clausen</b>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the publication of this book,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;Prof. Clausen
has put himself forward as a leader among the enemies of the
church and the perverters of God&rsquo;s word in this country. A church,
such as he advocates, that has no determinable form, exists only in
the brains of the theologians, and must be construed from theological
<span class="pb" id="pg_118">[118]</span>
speculations on the basis of a discredited Bible and according
to the changing thoughts and opinions of man, is plainly nothing
but a fantastic dream, a comic if it were not so tragic conception
of a Christian congregation which claims to confess the same faith,
but knows not what it is, and holds that it is instituted by God,
but cannot tell for what purpose before the theologians have found
it out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Against such a church, I place the historical church, that is
the church of the Gospel, instituted by Christ Himself, created by
His word and vivified by His Spirit. For I contend that the Christian
church now as always consists of that body of believers who
truly accept the faith of their baptismal covenant, Holy Baptism
and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper as the faith and means of salvation.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>The Reply of the Church</b> caused a sensation. It was read and
discussed everywhere. But if Grundtvig had hoped to force a general
discussion of the plight of the church, he was disappointed.
Prof. Clausen answered him with a lawsuit &ldquo;for malicious injury
to his professional honor&rdquo;; his enemies all condemned him, and his
friends were silent. If they approved of the substance of his charges,
they disapproved of their form. Grundtvig appeared to have
thrown away the last remnant of his already tattered reputation,
and only the years would reveal that in doing so he had struck a
deadlier blow against Rationalism than he had expected, that he
had, in fact, for years to come made Rationalism impossible in Denmark
as a form of Christianity.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Danish church was preparing to celebrate its
thousandth anniversary in May, 1826. Grundtvig looked forward
to the event with almost child-like anticipation, hoping that the
celebration might serve to awaken a new appreciation of the old
church. To heighten the festivities the authorities had authorized
pastors to select the hymns for the services in their own churches,
and Grundtvig had written and published a pamphlet of hymns to
be used in his church. But shortly before the festival, his bishop
informed him that only hymns from the authorized hymnal could
be chosen. As no one else had composed hymns for the occasion,
Grundtvig could not doubt that this new ruling was aimed solely
at him, and this new evidence at the length to which his enemies
would go for the sake of humiliating him appeared to him like the
last straw. He had long suffered under the difficulty of serving a
church which honored the law-breaker and persecuted the law-abiding
and thought of resigning. But he had a family to support.
<span class="pb" id="pg_119">[119]</span>
And while he himself would gladly bear the poverty his resignation
would inevitably bring him, he doubted his right to impose such a
burden upon his family. The difficulty was finally solved for him
by his wife, who one day came into his study and said: &ldquo;Father, I
know what is troubling you. You wish to resign and hesitate to do
so for our sake. But I want you to do whatever you think is right.
The Lord will provide for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it was settled. His resignation was handed to the authorities
a few days before the festival, and it was accepted so
quickly that he was released from office before the following Sunday.
When the festive Sunday came which he had looked forward
to with so much pleasure, he sat idly in his study across from the
church and watched people come for the service, but another pastor
preached the sermon, he had earnestly wished to deliver, and
other hymns than his own beloved songs served as vehicles for the
people&rsquo;s praise.</p>
<p>Public sentiment regarding Grundtvig&rsquo;s resignation varied. His
friends deplored the action, holding that he should have remained
in his pastorate both for the sake of his congregation and the cause
which he had so ably championed. But his opponents rejoiced,
seeing in his resignation just another proof of an erratic mentality.
For who had ever heard of a normal person withdrawing from a
secure and respectable position without even asking for the pension
to which he was entitled?</p>
<p>The six years during which Grundtvig remained without a
pulpit were among the busiest and most fruitful of his life. He
published his <b>Sunday-Book</b>, a collection of sermons which many
still rate among the finest devotional books in Danish; made extended
visits to England in 1829-1831, for the purpose of studying
the old Anglo Saxon manuscripts kept there, an undertaking that
awakened the interest of the English themselves in these great
treasures; wrote his splendid <b>Northern Mythology or Picture Language</b>,
and <b>The World&rsquo;s History after the Best Sources</b>, works in
which he presents the fundamental aspects of his historical, folk
and educational views that have made his name known not only
in Scandinavia but in almost every country in the world.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he again had entered the pulpit. As a compensation
for the loss of his ministry, a group of his friends shortly after his
resignation began to hold private assemblies. When Grundtvig
still firmly refused to take part in these, they decided to organize
an independent congregation, petition the government for permission
<span class="pb" id="pg_120">[120]</span>
to use an abandoned German Lutheran church and call Grundtvig
as their pastor. The petition was promptly refused, though
Grundtvig himself pleaded with the authorities to permit the organization
of an independent congregation as the best means of relieving
the dissatisfied members of the church and declared that he
would himself join the assemblies unless some such measure of relief
was granted. When the authorities ignored his plea, Grundtvig
made good his threat and appeared at the assemblies, drawing such
a crowd that no private home could possibly hold it, whereupon it
was decided to secure a public hall for future meetings. But when
the authorities heard this, they suddenly experienced a change of
heart and offered the troublesome preacher and his friends the use
of Frederik&rsquo;s church for a vesper service each Sunday.</p>
<p>The eight years Grundtvig served as an independent preacher
at the Frederik&rsquo;s church were among the happiest in his life. He
rejoiced to know that the large, diversified audience crowding the
sanctuary each Sunday came wholly of its own free will. It also
pleased the now gray-haired pastor to see an increasing number of
students become constant attendants at his services. Even so, his
position had its drawbacks. He was permitted neither to administer
the sacraments nor to instruct the young people, and the authorities
even denied him the right to confirm his own sons.
Grundtvig felt especially this refusal so keenly that he again was
thinking of resigning his pulpit when the king offered him an appointment
as pastor of Vartov, a large institution for the aged.</p>
<p>Thus from 1839 until Grundtvig&rsquo;s death the chapel at Vartov
became his home and that of his friends and the center of the fast
growing Grundtvigian movement. People from all walks of life,
from the Queen to the common laborer, became regular attendants
at the unpretentious sanctuary, and the eyes of some old people
still shine when they recall the moving spirit of the services there,
the venerable appearance and warm monotone voice of the pastor,
and, especially, the hearty, soul-stirring singing. Many of Grundtvig&rsquo;s
own great hymns were introduced at Vartov. From there they
spread throughout the church. And it was to a large extent the
hearty, inspiring congregational singing at Vartov which made the
Danish church a singing church.</p>

<p class="t0">Guiding all His children lowly</p>
<p class="t0">-: Unto Christ, our Lord and King :-</p>
</div>
<p>This lovely, childlike hymn, the first to appear from Grundtvig&rsquo;s
pen, was written in the fall of 1810 when its author was still
battling with despair and his mind faltering on the brink of insanity.
<span class="pb" id="pg_122">[122]</span>
Against this background the hymn appears like a ray of
sunlight breaking through a clouded sky. And as such it must undoubtedly
have come to its author. As an indication of Grundtvig&rsquo;s
simple trust in God, it is noteworthy that another of his most childlike
hymns, &ldquo;God&rsquo;s Child, Do Now Rest Thee,&rdquo; was likewise composed
during a similar period of distress that beset him many years later.</p>
<p>For a number of years Grundtvig&rsquo;s hymn of the Wise Men
represented his sole contribution to hymnody. Other interests engaged
his attention and absorbed his energy. During his years of
intense work with the sagas he only occasionally broke his &ldquo;engagement&rdquo;
with the dead to strike the lyre for the living. In 1815
he translated &ldquo;In Death&rsquo;s Strong Bonds Our Savior Lay&rdquo; from
Luther, and &ldquo;Christ Is Risen from the Dead&rdquo; from the Latin. The
three hundredth anniversary of the Reformation brought his adaptation
of Kingo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Like the Golden Sun Ascending&rdquo; and translations
of Luther&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Mighty Fortress Is Our God&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Bells
Ring in the Christmastide.&rdquo; In 1820 he published his now popular
&ldquo;A Babe Is Born at Bethlehem&rdquo; from an old Latin-Danish text, and
1824 saw his splendid rendering of &ldquo;The Old Day Song,&rdquo; &ldquo;With
Gladness We Hail the Blessed Day,&rdquo; and his original &ldquo;On Its Rock
the Church of Jesus Stood Mongst Us a Thousand Years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These songs constitute his whole contribution to hymnody from
1810 to 1825. But the latter year brought a signal increase. In the
midst of his fierce battle with the Rationalists he published the first
of his really great hymns, a song of comfort to the daughters of
Zion, sitting disconsolately at the sickbed of their mother, the
church. Her present state may appear so hopeless that her children
fear to remember her former glory:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Dares the anxious heart envision</p>
<p class="t0">Still its morning dream,</p>
<p class="t0">View, despite the world&rsquo;s derision,</p>
<p class="t0">Zion&rsquo;s sunlit height and stream?</p>
<p class="t0">Wields still anyone the power</p>
<p class="t0">To repeat her anthems strong,</p>
<p class="t0">And with joyful heart embower,</p>
<p class="t0">Zion with triumphant song.</p>
</div>
<p>Her condition is not hopeless, however, if her children will gather
about her.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Zion&rsquo;s sons and daughters rally</p>
<p class="t0">Now upon her ancient wall!</p>
<p class="t0">Have her foemen gained the valley,</p>
<p class="t0">Yet her ramparts did not fall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_123">[123]</div>
<p class="t0">Were her outer walls forsaken</p>
<p class="t0">Still her cornerstone remains,</p>
<p class="t0">Firm, unconquered and unshaken,</p>
<p class="t0">Making futile all their gains.</p>
</div>
<p>Another of his great hymns dates from the same year. Grundtvig
was in the habit of remaining up all night when he had to speak
on the following day. The Christmas of 1825 was particularly trying
to him. He had apparently forfeited his last vestige of honor by
publishing his <b>Reply of the Church</b>; the suit started against him by
Professor Clausen still dragged its laborious way through the court;
and his anxiety over the present state of the church was greatly
increased by the weight of his personal troubles. He felt very much
like the shepherds watching their flocks at night, except that no
angels appeared to help him with the message his people would
expect him to deliver in the morning. Perhaps he was unworthy
of such a favor. He rose, as was his custom, and made a round into
the bedrooms to watch his children. How innocently they slept!
If the angels could not come to him, they ought at least to visit
the children. If they heard the message, their elders might perchance
catch it through them.</p>
<p>Some such thought must have passed through the mind of the
lonely pastor as he sat musing upon his sermon throughout the
night, for he appeared unusually cheerful as he ascended his pulpit
Christmas morning, preached a joyful sermon, and said, at its conclusion,
that he had that night begotten a song which he wished to
read to them. That song has since become one of the most beloved
Christmas songs in the Danish language. To give an adequate reproduction
of its simple, childlike spirit in another language is perhaps
impossible, but it is hoped that the translation given below
will convey at least an impression of its cheerful welcome to the
Christmas angels.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Be welcome again, God&rsquo;s angels bright</p>
<p class="t0">From mansions of light and glory</p>
<p class="t0">To publish anew this wintry night</p>
<p class="t0">The wonderful Christmas story.</p>

<p class="t0">New year after winter hoary.</p>

<div class="verse">

<p class="t0">Ye will not this wintry night disdain</p>
<p class="t0">To enter our dwellings lowly.</p>
<p class="t0">And bring to each yearning heart again</p>
<p class="t0">The joy that is pure and holy.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_124">[124]</div>

<p class="t0">Oh, deign with these little ones to share</p>
<p class="t0">The joy from your message flowing.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">

<p class="t0">With angels around Him singing</p>
<p class="t0">The song of God&rsquo;s glory, peace, good-will</p>
<p class="t0">That joy to all hearts is bringing,</p>
<p class="t0">While far over mountain, field and hill,</p>
<p class="t0">The bells are with gladness ringing.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">God&rsquo;s angels with joy to earth descend</p>

<p class="t0">To all who for peace have panted;</p>
<p class="t0">The portals of heaven open stand;</p>
<p class="t0">The Kingdom to us is granted.</p>
</div>
<p>In 1826 Grundtvig, as already related, published his hymns for
the thousand years&rsquo; festival of his church. But a few months later
he again buried himself in his study, putting aside the lyre, which
for a little while he had played so beautifully. Many had already
noticed his hymns, however, and continued to plead with him for
more. The new Evangelical revival, which he had largely inspired,
intensified the general dissatisfaction with the rationalistic Evangelical
Christian Hymnal, and called for hymns embodying the
spirit of the new movement. And who could better furnish these
than Grundtvig? Of those who pleaded with him for new hymns,
none was more persistent than his friend, Pastor Gunni Busck.
When Grundtvig wrote to him in 1832 that his <b>Northern Mythology</b>
was nearing completion, Busck at once answered: &ldquo;Do not forget
your more important work; do not forget our old hymns! I know
no one else with your ability to brush the dust off our old songs.&rdquo;
But Grundtvig was still too busy with other things to comply with
the wish of his most faithful and helpful friend.</p>
<p>During the ensuing years, however, a few hymns occasionally
appeared from his pen. A theological student, L. C. Hagen, secured
a few adapted and original hymns from him for a small collection
of <b>Historical Hymns and Rhymes for Children</b>, which was published
in 1832. But the adaptations were not successful. Despite the good
opinion of Gunni Busck, Grundtvig was too independent a spirit to
adjust himself to the style and mode of others. His originals were
much more successful. Among these we find such gems as &ldquo;Mongst
<span class="pb" id="pg_125">[125]</span>
His Brothers Called the Little,&rdquo; &ldquo;Move the Signs of Grief and
Mourning from the Garden of the Dead,&rdquo; and &ldquo;O Land of Our
King,&rdquo; hymns that rank with the finest he has written.</p>
<p>In 1835 Grundtvig at last wrote to Gunni Busck that he was
now ready to commence the long deferred attempt to renew the
hymnody of his church. Busck received the information joyfully
and at once sent him a thousand dollars to support him during his
work. Others contributed their mite, making Grundtvig richer
financially than he had been for many years. He rented a small
home on the shores of the Sound and began to prepare himself for
the work before him by an extensive study of Christian hymnody,
both ancient and modern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old hymns sound beautiful to me out here under the
sunny sky and with the blue water of the Sound before me,&rdquo; he
wrote to Busck. He did not spend his days day-dreaming, however,
but worked with such intensity that only a year later he was
able to invite subscriptions on the first part of his work. The complete
collection was published in 1837 under the title: <b>Songs of the
Danish Church</b>. It contains in all 401 hymns and songs composed of
originals, translations and adaptations from Greek, Latin, German,
Icelandic, Anglo-Saxon, English and Scandinavian sources. The
material is of very unequal merit, ranging from the superior to
the commonplace. As originally composed, the collection could
not be used as a hymnal. But many of the finest hymns now used in
the Danish church have been selected or adapted from it.</p>
<p>Although <b>Songs for the Danish Church</b> is now counted among
the great books in Danish, its appearance attracted little attention
outside the circle of Grundtvig&rsquo;s friends. It was not even reviewed
in the press. The literati, both inside and outside the church, still
publicly ignored Grundtvig. But privately a few of them expressed
their opinion about the work. Thus a Pastor P. Hjort wrote to
Bishop Mynster, &ldquo;Have you read Grundtvig&rsquo;s <b>Songs of the Danish
Church</b>? It is a typical Grundtvigian book, wordy, ingenious, mystical,
poetical and full of half digested ideas. His language is rich
and wonderfully expressive. But he is not humble enough to write
hymns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the demand for a new hymnal or at least for a
supplement to the old had become so insistent that something had
to be done. J. P. Mynster who, shortly before, had been appointed
Bishop of Sj&aelig;lland, favored a supplement and obtained an authorization
from the king for the appointment of a committee to prepare
<span class="pb" id="pg_126">[126]</span>
it. The only logical man to head such a committee was, of
course, Grundtvig. But Mynster&rsquo;s dislike of his volcanic relative
was so deep-rooted that he was incapable of giving any recognition
to him. And so in order to avoid a too obvious slight to his country&rsquo;s
best known hymnwriter, he assigned the work to an already
existing committee on liturgy, of which he himself was president.
Thus Grundtvig was forced to sit idly by while the work naturally
belonging to him was being executed by a man with no special
ability for the task. The supplement appeared in 1843. It contained
thirty-six hymns of which six were written by Kingo, seven by
Brorson, and one by Grundtvig, the latter being, as Grundtvig
humorously remarked, set to the tune of the hymn, &ldquo;Lord, I Have
Done Wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mynster&rsquo;s influence was great enough to secure the supplement
a wide circulation. The collection, nevertheless, failed to satisfy
the need of the church. Dissatisfaction with it was so general that
the pastors&rsquo; conference of Copenhagen appointed a committee consisting
of Grundtvig, Prof. Martensen, Mynster&rsquo;s own son-in-law,
Rev. Pauli, his successor as Provost of the Church of Our Lady, and
two other pastors to prepare and present a proposal for a new
hymnal. It was an able committee from which a meritorious work
might reasonably be expected.</p>
<p>Grundtvig was assigned to the important work of selecting and
revising the old hymns to be included in the collection. He was an
inspiring but at times difficult co-worker. Martensen recalls how
Grundtvig at times aroused the committee to enthusiasm by an impromptu
talk on hymnody or a recitation of one of the old hymns,
which he loved so well. But he also recalls how he sometimes flared
up and stormed out of the committee room in anger over some proposed
change or correction of his work. When his anger subsided,
however, he always conscientiously attempted to effect whatever
changes the committee agreed on proposing. Yet excellent as much
of his own work was, he possessed no particular gift for mending
the work of others, and his corrections of one defect often resulted
in another.</p>
<p>The committee submitted its work to the judgment of the conference
in January 1845. The proposal included 109 hymns of which
nineteen were by Kingo, seven by Brorson, ten by Ingemann, twenty-five
by Grundtvig and the remainder by various other writers,
old and new. It appeared to be a well balanced collection, giving
due recognition to such newer writers as Boye, Ingemann, Grundtvig
<span class="pb" id="pg_127">[127]</span>
and others. But the conference voted to reject it. Admitting its
poetical excellence and its sound Evangelical tenor, some of the
pastors complained that it contained too many new and too few
old hymns; others held that it bore too clearly the imprint of one
man, a complaint which no doubt expressed the sentiment of Mynster
and his friends. A petition to allow such churches as should by
a majority vote indicate their wish to use the collection was likewise
rejected by the Bishop.</p>
<p>Grundtvig was naturally disappointed by the rejection of a
work upon which he had spent so much time and energy. The rejection
furthermore showed him that he still could expect no consideration
from the authorities with Mynster in control. He was
soon able, however, to comfort himself with the fact that his hymns
were becoming popular in private assemblies throughout the country,
and that even a number of churches were beginning to use
them at their regular services in defiance of official edicts. The
demand for granting more liberty to the laymen in their church
life, a demand Grundtvig long had advocated, was in fact becoming
so strong that the authorities at times found it advisable to overlook
minor infractions of official rulings. Noting this new policy, Grundtvig
himself ventured to introduce some of the new hymns into his
church. In the fall of 1845, he published a small collection of
Christmas hymns to be used at the impending Christmas festival.
When the innovation passed without objections, a similar collection
of Easter hymns was introduced at the Easter services, after which
other collections for the various seasons of the church year appeared
quite regularly until all special prints were collected into
one volume and used as &ldquo;the hymnal of Vartov.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The work of preparing a new authorized hymnal was finally
given to Grundtvig&rsquo;s closest friend, Ingemann. This hymnal appeared
in 1855, under the title, <b>Roskilde Convent&rsquo;s Psalmbook</b>.
This book served as the authorized hymnal of the Danish church
until 1899, when it was replaced by <b>Hymnal for Church and Home</b>,
the hymnal now used in nearly all Danish churches both at home
and abroad. It contains in all 675 hymns of which 96 are by Kingo,
107 by Brorson, 29 by Ingemann and 173 by Grundtvig, showing
that the latter at last had been recognized as the foremost hymnwriter
of the Danish church.</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_128">[128]</div>
<h4>Chapter Fifteen
<span class="chaptertitle">Grundtvig&rsquo;s Hymns</span></h4>
<p>Grundtvig wrote most of his hymns when he was past middle
age, a man of extensive learning, proved poetical ability and
mature judgment, especially in spiritual things. Years of hard
struggles and unjust neglect had sobered and mellowed but not
aged or embittered him.</p>
<p>His long study of hymnology together with his exceptional
poetical gift enabled him to adopt material from all ages and
branches of Christian song, and to wield it into a homogenous
hymnody for his own church. His treatment of the material is
usually very free, so free that it is often difficult to discover any
relationship between his translations and their supposed originals.
Instead of endeavoring to transfer the metre, phrasing and sentiment
of the original text, he frequently adopts only a single thought
or a general idea from its content, and expresses this in his own
language and form.</p>
<p>His original hymns likewise bear the imprint of his ripe knowledge
and spiritual understanding. They are for the most part objective
in content and sentiment, depicting the great themes of
Biblical history, doctrine and life rather than the personal feeling
and experiences of the individual. A large number of his hymns
are, in fact, faithful but often striking adaptations of Bible stories
and texts. For though he was frequently accused of belittling the
Book of Books, his hymns to a larger extent than those of any other
Danish hymnwriter are directly inspired by the language of the
Bible. He possessed an exceptional ability to absorb the essential
implications of a text and to present it with the terseness and force
of an adage.</p>
<p>Although Grundtvig&rsquo;s hymns at times attain the height of pure
poetry, their poetic merit is incidental rather than sought. In the
pride of his youth he had striven, as he once complained, to win
the laurel wreath, but had found it to be an empty honor. His
style is more often forceful than lyrical. When the mood was upon
him he could play the lyre with entrancing beauty and gentleness,
but he preferred the organ with all stops out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_129">[129]</div>
<p>His style is often rough but expressive and rich in imagery. In
this he strove to supplant time-honored similes and illustrations
from Biblical lands with native allusions and scenes. Pictures drawn
from the Danish landscape, lakes and streams, summer and winter,
customs and life abound in his songs, giving them a home-like touch
that has endeared them to millions.</p>
<p>His poetry is of very unequal merit. He was a prolific writer,
producing, besides many volumes of poetry on various subjects,
about three thousand hymns and songs. Among much that is excellent
in this vast production there are also dreary stretches of
rambling loquacity, hollow rhetoric and unintelligible jumbles of
words and phrases. He could be insupportably dull and again express
more in a single stanza, couplet or phrase than many have
said in a whole book. A study of his poetry is, therefore, not unlike
a journey through a vast country, alternating in fertile valleys,
barren plains and lofty heights with entrancing views into far, dim
vistas.</p>
<p>This inconsistency in the work of a man so eminently gifted as
Grundtvig is explainable only by his method of writing. He was
an intuitive writer and preferred to be called a &ldquo;skjald&rdquo; instead of
a poet. The distinction is significant but somewhat difficult to define.
As Grundtvig himself understood the term, the &ldquo;skjald&rdquo;, besides
being a poet, must also be a seer, a man able to envision and
express what was still hidden to the common mortal. &ldquo;The skjald
is,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;the chosen lookout of life who must reveal from his
mountain what he sees at life&rsquo;s deep fountain. When gripped by his
vision,&rdquo; he says further, the skjald is &ldquo;neither quiescent nor lifeless
but, on the contrary, lifted up into an exceptional state of sensitiveness
in which he sees and feels things with peculiar vividness and
power. I know of nothing in this material world to which the
skjald may more fittingly be likened than a tuned harp with the
wind playing upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A skjald in Grundtvig&rsquo;s conception was thus a man endowed
with the gift of receiving direct impressions of life and things, of
perceiving especially the deeper and more fundamental truths of
existence intuitively instead of intellectually. Such perceptions, he
admitted, might lack the apparent clarity of reasoned conclusions,
but would approach nearer to the truth. For life must be understood
from within, must be spiritually discerned. It could never be
comprehended by mere intellect or catalogued by supposed science.</p>
<p>He knew, however, that his work was frequently criticized for
<span class="pb" id="pg_130">[130]</span>
its ambiguity and lack of consistency. But he claimed that these
defects were unavoidable consequences of his way of writing. He
had to write what he saw and could not be expected to express that
clearly which he himself saw only dimly. &ldquo;I naturally desire to
please my readers,&rdquo; he wrote to Ingemann, &ldquo;but when I write as
my intuition dictates, it works well; ideas and images come to me
without effort, and I fly lightly as the gazelle from crag to crag,
whereas if I warn myself that there must be a limit to everything
and that I must restrain myself and write sensibly, I am stopped
right there. And I have thus to choose between writing as the spirit
moves me, or not writing at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This statement, although it casts a revealing light both upon his
genius and its evident limitations, is no doubt extreme. However
much Grundtvig may have depended on his momentary inspiration
for the poetical development of his ideas, his fundamental views on
life were exceptionally clear and comprehensive. He knew what he
believed regarding the essential verities of existence, of God and
man, of good and evil, of life and death. And all other conceptions
of his intuitive and far-reaching spirit were consistently correlated
to these basic beliefs.</p>
<p>Bishop H. Martensen, the celebrated theologian, relates an illuminating
conversation between Grundtvig and the German theologian,
P. K. Marheincke, during a visit which the Bishop had arranged
between the two men. Dr. Marheincke commenced a
lengthy discourse on the great opposites in life, as for instance between
thinking and being, and Grundtvig replied, &ldquo;My opposites are
life and death&rdquo; (Mein Gegensatz ist Leben und Tod).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The professor accepted my statement somewhat dubiously,&rdquo;
Grundtvig said later, &ldquo;and admitted that that was indeed a great
contrast, but&mdash;&rdquo; The difference between the two men no doubt lay
in the fact that Prof. Marheincke, the speculative theologian, was
principally interested in the first part of the assumed contrast&mdash;thinking,
whereas Grundtvig&rsquo;s main concern was with the last&mdash;being,
existence, life. In real life there could be no more fundamental,
no farther reaching contrast than the continuous and irreconcilable
difference between life and death. The thought of this
contrast lies at the root of all his thinking and colors all his views.
From the day of his conversion until the hour of his death, his one
consuming interest was to illuminate the contrast between the two
irreconcilable enemies and to encourage anything that would
strengthen the one and defeat the other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_131">[131]</div>
<p>Grundtvig loved life in all its highest aspects and implications,
and he hated death under whatever form he saw it. &ldquo;Life is from
heaven, death is from hell,&rdquo; he says in a characteristic poem. The
one is representative of all the good the Creator intended for his
creatures, the other of all the evil, frustration and destruction the
great destroyer brought into the world. There can be no reconciliation
or peace between the two, the one must inevitably destroy
or be destroyed by the other. He could see nothing but deception
in the attempts of certain philosophical or theological phrasemakers
to minimize or explain away the eternal malignity of death, man&rsquo;s
most relentless foe. A human being could fall no lower than to accept
death as a friend. Thus in a poem:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Yea, hear it, ye heavens, with loathing and grief;</p>
<p class="t0">The sons of the Highest now look for relief</p>
<p class="t2">In the ways of damnation</p>
<p class="t2">And find consolation</p>
<p class="t0">In hopes of eternal death.</p>
</div>
<p>But death is not present only at the hour of our demise. It is
present everywhere; it is active in all things. It destroys nations,
corrupts society, robs the child of its innocence, wipes the bloom
from the cheeks of youth, frustrates the possibilities of manhood and
makes pitiful the white hair of the aged. For death, as all must see,
is only the wage of sin, the ripe fruit of evil.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I recognize now clearly;</p>
<p class="t0">Death is the wage of sin,</p>
<p class="t0">It is the fruitage merely</p>
<p class="t0">Of evil&rsquo;s growth within.</p>
</div>
<p>And its danger is so actual because it is active in every individual
in himself as well as in others:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When I view the true condition</p>
<p class="t0">Of my troubled, restless heart,</p>
<p class="t0">Naught but sin can I envision</p>
<p class="t0">Even to its inmost part.</p>
</div>
<p>Such then is his fundamental view of the condition of man, a being
in the destructive grip of a relentless foe, a creature whose greatest
need is &ldquo;a hero who can break the bonds of death&rdquo;. And there is but
one who can do that, the Son of God.</p>
<p>Grundtvig&rsquo;s hymns abound in terms of adoration for the Savior
of Man. He names Him the &ldquo;Joy of Heaven&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Fortune of
Earth&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Fount of Light&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Sovereign of Life&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Fear
of Darkness&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Terror of Death&rdquo;, and speaks of the day when
<span class="pb" id="pg_132">[132]</span>
all the &ldquo;nations of the earth shall offer praise in the offer bowl of
His name.&rdquo; But he sees the Christ less as the suffering Lamb of
God than as the invincible conqueror of death and the heroic deliverer
of man.</p>
<p>Like his other hymns most of his hymns to the Savior are objective
rather than subjective. They present the Christ of the Gospels,
covering his life so fully that it would be possible to compile
from them an almost complete sequence on His life, work and resurrection.
The following stately hymn may serve as an appropriate
introduction to a necessarily brief survey of the group:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jesus, the name without compare;</p>
<p class="t0">Honored on earth and in heaven,</p>
<p class="t0">Wherein the Father&rsquo;s love and care</p>
<p class="t0">Are to His children now given.</p>
<p class="t0">Saviour of all that saved would be,</p>
<p class="t0">Fount of salvation full and free</p>
<p class="t0">Is the Lord Jesus forever.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jesus, the name alone on earth</p>
<p class="t0">For our salvation afforded.</p>
<p class="t0">So on His cross of precious worth</p>
<p class="t0">Is in His blood it recorded.</p>
<p class="t0">Only in that our prayers are heard,</p>
<p class="t0">Only in that when hearts are stirred</p>
<p class="t0">Doth now the Spirit us comfort.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jesus, the name above the sky</p>
<p class="t0">Wherein, when seasons are ended,</p>
<p class="t0">Peoples shall come to God on high,</p>
<p class="t0">And every knee shall be bended,</p>
<p class="t0">While all the saved in sweet accord</p>
<p class="t0">Chorus the praise of Christ, the Lord,</p>
<p class="t0">Savior beloved by the Father.</p>
</div>
<p>Grundtvig sang of Christmas morning &ldquo;as his heaven on earth&rdquo;,
and he wrote some of the finest Christmas hymns in the Danish
language. A number of these have already been given. The following
simple hymn from an old Latin-Danish text is still very popular.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">A babe is born in Bethlehem,</p>
<p class="t0">Bethlehem,</p>
<p class="t0">Rejoice, rejoice Jerusalem;</p>

</div>
<p>His hymns on the life and work of our Lord are too numerous
to be more than indicated here. The following hymn on the text,
&ldquo;Blessed are the eyes that see what ye see, and the ears that hear
what ye hear&rdquo;, is typical of his expository hymns.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Blessed were the eyes that truly</p>
<p class="t0">Here on earth beheld the Lord;</p>
<p class="t0">Happy were the ears that duly</p>

<p>Grundtvig reaches his greatest height in his hymns of praise
to Christ, the Redeemer. Many of his passion hymns have not been
translated into English. In the original, the following hymn undoubtedly
ranks with the greatest songs of praise to the suffering
Lord.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Hail Thee, Savior and Atoner!</p>
<p class="t0">Though the world Thy name dishonor,</p>
<p class="t0">Moved by love my heart proposes</p>

<p class="t0">Even death that we might live.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Love alone Thy heart was filling</p>
<p class="t0">When to suffer Thou wert willing.</p>
<p class="t0">Rather givest Thou than takest,</p>

<p class="t0">All to die in sinner&rsquo;s place.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Ah, my heart in deep contrition</p>
<p class="t0">Now perceives its true condition,</p>
<p class="t0">Cold and barren like a mountain,</p>
<p class="t0">How could I deserve the fountain</p>
<p class="t0">Of Thy love, my Savior dear.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Yet I know that from thy passion</p>

</div>
<p>Grundtvig&rsquo;s Easter hymns strike the triumphant note, especially
such hymns as &ldquo;Christ Arose in Glory&rdquo;, &ldquo;Easter Morrow Stills
Our Sorrow&rdquo;, and the very popular,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Move the signs of gloom and mourning<sup><a id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p class="t0">From the garden of the dead.</p>
<p class="t0">For the wreaths of grief and yearning,</p>
<p class="t0">Plant bright lilies in their stead.</p>
<p class="t0">Carve instead of sighs of grief</p>
<p class="t0">Angels&rsquo; wings in bold relief,</p>
<p class="t0">And for columns, cold and broken,</p>
<p class="t0">Words of hope by Jesus spoken.</p>
</div>
<p>His Easter hymns fail as a whole to reach the height of his songs
for other church festivals. In this respect, they resemble the hymnody
of the whole church, which contains remarkably few really
great hymns on the greatest events in its history. It is as though
the theme were too great to be expressed in the language of man.</p>
<p>Grundtvig wrote a number of magnificent hymns on the themes
of our Lord&rsquo;s ascension and His return to judge the quick and the
dead. Of the latter, the hymn given below is perhaps the most favored
of those now available in English.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_136">[136]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lift up thy head, O Christendom!</p>
<p class="t0">Behold above the blessed home</p>
<p class="t0">For which thy heart is yearning.</p>
<p class="t0">There dwells the Lord, thy soul&rsquo;s delight,</p>
<p class="t0">Who soon with power and glory bright</p>
<p class="t0">Is for His bride returning.</p>
</div>

<p>Grundtvig is often called the Singer of Pentecost. And his
hymns on the nature and work of the Spirit do rank with his very
best. He believed in the reality of the Spirit as the living, active
agent of Christ in His church. As the church came into being by
the outpouring of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost, so our
Lord still builds and sanctifies it by the Spirit, working through
His words and sacraments. His numerous hymns on the Spirit are
drawn from many sources, both ancient and modern. His treatment
of the originals is so free, however, that it is difficult in most cases
to know whether his versions should be accepted as adaptations or
originals. Of mere translations there are none. The following version
of the widely known hymn, &ldquo;Veni Sancte Spiritus,&rdquo; may serve
to illustrate his work as a transplanter of hymns.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_137">[137]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Holy Spirit, come with light,</p>
<p class="t0">Break the dark and gloomy night</p>

<p class="t0">Greet the Lord&rsquo;s triumphant day</p>
<p class="t0">Now with might ascending.</p>

<div class="verse">

</div>
<p>Many of Grundtvig&rsquo;s original hymns evince a strong Danish
coloring, a fact which is especially evident in a number of his Pentecost
hymns. Pentecost comes in Denmark at the first breath of
summer when nature, prompted by balmy breezes, begins to unfold
her latent life and beauty. This similarity between the life of nature
and the work of the Spirit is strikingly expressed in a number of his
Pentecost hymns.</p>
<p>The following hymn, together with its beautiful tune, is rated
as one of the most beautiful and, lyrically, most perfect hymns in
Danish. Because of its strong Danish flavor, however, it may not
make an equal appeal to American readers. The main thought of
the hymn is that, as in nature, so also in the realm of the Spirit,
summer is now at hand. The coming of the Spirit completes God&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="pg_138">[138]</span>
plan of salvation and opens the door for the unfolding of a new
life. The translation is by Prof. S. D. Rodholm.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The sun now shines in all its splendor,</p>
<p class="t0">The fount of life and mercy tender;</p>
<p class="t0">Now bright Whitsunday lilies grow</p>
<p class="t0">And summer sparkles high and low;</p>
<p class="t0">Sweet songsters sing of harvest gold</p>

</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The peaceful nightingales are filling</p>
<p class="t0">The quiet night with music thrilling.</p>
<p class="t0">Thus all that to the Lord belong</p>

<p class="t0">May dream of life beyond the skies,</p>
<p class="t0">And with God&rsquo;s praise at daylight rise.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">It breathes from heaven on the flowers,</p>
<p class="t0">It whispers home-like in the bowers,</p>
<p class="t0">A balmy breeze comes to our coast</p>
<p class="t0">From Paradise, no longer closed,</p>
<p class="t0">And gently purls a brooklet sweet</p>

<p>Of his other numerous hymns on the Spirit, the one given below
is, perhaps, one of the most characteristic.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Holy Ghost, our Interceder,</p>
<p class="t0">Blessed Comforter and Pleader</p>

<p class="t0">Add Thy voice to our petition</p>
<p class="t0">As we pray in Jesus&rsquo; name.</p>
</div>
<p>Believing in the Spirit, Grundtvig also believed in the kingdom
of God, not only as a promise of the future but as a reality of the
present.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Right among us is God&rsquo;s kingdom</p>
<p class="t0">With His Spirit and His word,</p>
<p class="t0">With His grace and love abundant</p>
<p class="t0">At His font and altar-board.</p>
</div>
<p>Among his numerous hymns on the nature and work of God&rsquo;s
kingdom, the following is one of the most favored.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Founded our Lord has upon earth a realm of the Spirit</p>
<p class="t0">Wherein He fosters a people restored by His merit.</p>
<p class="t3">It shall remain</p>
<p class="t3">People its glory attain,</p>
<p class="t0">They shall the kingdom inherit.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Forward like light of the morning its message is speeding,</p>
<p class="t0">Millions receive and proclaim it with gladness exceeding</p>
<p class="t3">For with His word</p>
<p class="t3">God doth His Spirit accord,</p>
<p class="t0">Raising all barriers impeding.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jesus, our Savior, with God in the highest residing,</p>
<p class="t0">And by the Spirit the wants of Thy people providing,</p>
<p class="t3">Be Thou our life,</p>
<p class="t3">Shield and defender in strife,</p>
<p class="t0">Always among us abiding.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Then shall Thy people as Lord of the nations restore Thee,</p>
<p class="t0">Even by us shall a pathway be straightened before Thee</p>
<p class="t3">Till everywhere,</p>
<p class="t3">Bending in worship and prayer,</p>
<p class="t0">All shall as Savior adore Thee.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_140">[140]</div>
<p>The kingdom of God is the most wonderful thing on earth.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Most wonderful of all things is</p>
<p class="t0">The kingdom Jesus founded.</p>
<p class="t0">Its glory, treasure, peace and bliss</p>
<p class="t0">No tongue has fully sounded.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Invisible as mind and soul,</p>
<p class="t0">And yet of light the fountain,</p>
<p class="t0">It sheds its light from pole to pole</p>
<p class="t0">Like beacons from a mountain.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Its secret is the word of God,</p>
<p class="t0">Which works what it proposes,</p>
<p class="t0">Which lowers mountains high and broad</p>
<p class="t0">And clothes the wastes with roses.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Though foes against the kingdom rage</p>
<p class="t0">With hatred and derision,</p>
<p class="t0">God spreads its reign from age to age,</p>
<p class="t0">And brings it to fruition.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Its glory rises like a morn</p>
<p class="t0">When waves at sunrise glitter,</p>
<p class="t0">Or as in June the golden corn</p>
<p class="t0">While birds above it twitter.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">It is the glory of the King</p>
<p class="t0">Who bore affliction solely</p>
<p class="t0">That he the crown of life might bring</p>
<p class="t0">To sinners poor and lowly.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And when His advent comes to pass,</p>
<p class="t0">The Christian&rsquo;s strife is ended,</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Then shall the kingdom bright appear</p>

<p class="t0">And usher in the golden year</p>
<p class="t0">Of peace and joy eternal.</p>
</div>
<p>But the kingdom of God here on earth is represented by the
Christian church, wherein Christ works by the Spirit through His
word and sacraments. Of Grundtvig&rsquo;s many splendid hymns of the
church, the following, in the translation of Pastor Carl Doving, has
become widely known in all branches of the Lutheran church in
America. Pastor Doving&rsquo;s translation is not wholly satisfactory,
however, to those who know the forceful and yet so appealing
language of the original, a fate which, we are fully aware, may also
befall the following new version.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_141">[141]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Built on a rock the church of God</p>
<p class="t0">Stands though its towers be falling;</p>
<p class="t0">Many have crumbled beneath the sod,</p>
<p class="t0">Bells still are chiming and calling,</p>
<p class="t0">Calling the young and old to come,</p>
<p class="t0">But above all the souls that roam,</p>
<p class="t0">Weary for rest everlasting.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">God, the most high, abides not in</p>
<p class="t0">Temples that hands have erected.</p>
<p class="t0">High above earthly strife and sin,</p>
<p class="t0">He hath his mansions perfected.</p>
<p class="t0">Yet He, whom heavens cannot contain,</p>
<p class="t0">Chose to abide on earth with man</p>
<p class="t0">Making their body His temple.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">We are God&rsquo;s house of living stones,</p>
<p class="t0">Built for the Spirit&rsquo;s indwelling.</p>
<p class="t0">He at His font and table owns</p>
<p class="t0">Us for His glory excelling.</p>
<p class="t0">Should only two confess His name,</p>
<p class="t0">He would yet come and dwell with them,</p>
<p class="t0">Granting His mercy abounding.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Even the temples built on earth</p>
<p class="t0">Unto the praise of the Father,</p>
<p class="t0">Are like the homes of hallowed worth</p>
<p class="t0">Whence we as children did gather.</p>
<p class="t0">Glorious things in them are said,</p>
<p class="t0">God there with us His covenant made,</p>
<p class="t0">Making us heirs of His kingdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">There we behold the font at which</p>
<p class="t0">God as His children received us;</p>
<p class="t0">There stands the altar where His rich</p>
<p class="t0">Mercy from hunger relieved us.</p>
<p class="t0">There His blest word to us proclaim:</p>
<p class="t0">Jesus is now and e&rsquo;er the same,</p>
<p class="t0">So is His way of salvation.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Grant then, O Lord, where&rsquo;er we roam,</p>
<p class="t0">That, when the church bells are ringing,</p>
<p class="t0">People in Jesus&rsquo; name may come,</p>
<p class="t0">Praising His glory with singing.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Ye, not the world, my face shall see;</p>
<p class="t0">I will abide with you,&rdquo; said He.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;My peace I leave with you ever.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>As a believer in objective Christianity, Grundtvig naturally
exalts the God-given means of grace, the word and sacraments,
through which the Spirit works. In one of the epigrammatic expressions
often found in his writings, he says:</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_142">[142]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">We are and remain,</p>
<p class="t0">We live and attain</p>
<p class="t0">In Jesus, God&rsquo;s living word</p>
<p class="t0">When His word we embrace</p>
<p class="t0">And live by its grace,</p>
<p class="t0">Then dwells He within us, our Lord.</p>
</div>
<p>This firm belief in the actual presence of Christ in His word
and sacraments lends an exceptional realism to many of his hymns
on the means of grace. Through the translation by Pastor Doving
the following brief hymn has gained wide renown in America.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">God&rsquo;s word is our great heritage,</p>
<p class="t0">And shall be ours forever.</p>
<p class="t0">To spread its light from age to age,</p>
<p class="t0">Shall be our chief endeavor.</p>
<p class="t0">Through life it guards our way,</p>
<p class="t0">In death it is our stay.</p>
<p class="t0">Lord, grant, while worlds endure,</p>
<p class="t0">We keep its teachings pure</p>
<p class="t0">Throughout all generations.</p>
</div>
<p>Of his numerous hymns on baptism, the following, which an
American authority on hymnody calls the finest baptismal hymn
ever written, is perhaps the most representative.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O let Thy spirit with us tarry,</p>
<p class="t0">Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,</p>
<p class="t0">So that the babes we to Thee carry</p>
<p class="t0">May be unto Thy death baptized.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lord, after Thee we humbly name them,</p>
<p class="t0">O let them in Thy name arise!</p>
<p class="t0">If they should stumble, Lord, reclaim them,</p>
<p class="t0">That they may reach Thy paradise.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">If long their course, let them not falter.</p>
<p class="t0">Give to Thine aged servants rest.</p>
<p class="t0">If short their race, let by Thine altar</p>
<p class="t0">Them like the swallows find a rest.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Upon their heart, Thy name be written,</p>
<p class="t0">And theirs within Thine own right hand,</p>
<p class="t0">That even when by trials smitten,</p>
<p class="t0">They in Thy covenant firm may stand.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thine angels sing for children sleeping,</p>
<p class="t0">May they still sing when death draws nigh.</p>
<p class="t0">Both cross and crown are in Thy keeping.</p>
<p class="t0">Lord, lead us all to Thee on high.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_143">[143]</div>
<p>His communion hymns are gathered from many sources. Of his
originals the following tender hymn is perhaps the most typical.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Savior, whither should we go</p>
<p class="t0">From the truest friend we know,</p>
<p class="t0">From the Son of God above,</p>
<p class="t0">From the Fount of saving love,</p>
<p class="t0">Who in all this world of strife</p>
<p class="t0">Hath alone the word of life.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">No, I dare not turn from Thee,</p>
<p class="t0">Though Thy word oft chasten me,</p>
<p class="t0">For throughout this world, O Lord,</p>
<p class="t0">Death is still the cruel word.</p>
<p class="t0">Whoso saves the soul from death</p>
<p class="t0">Brings redemption, life and breath.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Eat my flesh and drink my blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Saith our Lord, so kind and good.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Whoso takes the bread and wine,</p>
<p class="t0">Shall receive my life divine,</p>
<p class="t0">Be redeemed from all his foes</p>
<p class="t0">And arise as I arose.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Hear Him then, my heart distressed,</p>
<p class="t0">Beating anxious in my breast.</p>
<p class="t0">Take Thy Savior at His word,</p>
<p class="t0">Meet Him at His altar-board,</p>
<p class="t0">Eat His body, drink His blood,</p>
<p class="t0">And obtain eternal good.</p>
</div>
<p>Grundtvig also produced a great number of hymns for the enrichment
of other parts of the church service. Few hymns thus
strike a more appropriate and festive note for the opening service
than the short hymn given below.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come, Zion, and sing to the Father above;</p>
<p class="t0">Angels join with you</p>
<p class="t0">And thank Him for Jesus, the gifts of His love.</p>
<p class="t3">We sing before God in the highest.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Strike firmly, O Psalmist, the jubilant chord;</p>
<p class="t0">Golden be your harp</p>

<p class="t3">We sing before God in the highest.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Then hear we with rapture the tongues as of fire,</p>

<p class="t3">We sing before God in the highest.</p>

<p>Equally fine is his free rendering of the 84th psalm.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Fair beyond telling,</p>
<p class="t0">Lord, is Thy dwelling,</p>

</div>
<p>Grundtvig&rsquo;s hymns are for the most part church hymns, presenting
the objective rather than the subjective phase of Christian
faith. He wrote for the congregation and held that a hymn for congregational
singing should express the common faith and hope of
the worshippers, rather than the personal feelings and experiences
of the individual. Because of this his hymns are frequently criticized
for their lack of personal sentiment. The personal note is not
wholly lacking in his work, however, as witnessed by the following
hymn.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t3">Suffer and languish,</p>
<p class="t3">Tremble in anguish</p>
<p class="t0">Must every soul that awakes to its guilt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_145">[145]</div>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t3">Tremble with gladness,</p>
<p class="t3">Smile through their sadness</p>
<p class="t0">Shall all that rest in the arms of the Lord.</p>

<p class="t3">Comfort and treasure</p>
<p class="t0">Gathers the heart from His merciful word.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t3">Bravely to suffer,</p>
<p class="t3">Gladly to offer</p>
<p class="t0">Praises to God &rsquo;neath the weight of our cross,</p>
<p class="t3">This will the Spirit</p>
<p class="t3">Help us to merit</p>
<p class="t0">Granting a breath from God&rsquo;s heaven to us.</p>
</div>
<p>Even stronger is the personal sentiment of this appealing hymn.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">With her cruse of alabaster,</p>
<p class="t0">Filled with ointment rare and sweet,</p>
<p class="t0">Came the woman to the Master,</p>
<p class="t0">Knelt contritely at His feet,</p>
<p class="t0">Feeling with unfeigned contrition</p>
<p class="t0">How unfit was her condition</p>
<p class="t0">To approach the Holy One.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Like this woman, I contritely</p>
<p class="t0">Often must approach the Lord,</p>
<p class="t0">Knowing that I cannot rightly</p>
<p class="t0">Ask a place beside His board.</p>
<p class="t0">Sinful and devoid of merit,</p>
<p class="t0">I can only cry in spirit:</p>
<p class="t0">Lord, be merciful to me.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lord of Grace and Mercy, harken</p>
<p class="t0">To my plea for grace and light.</p>
<p class="t0">Threatening clouds and tempests darken</p>
<p class="t0">Now my soul with gloomy night.</p>
<p class="t0">Let, despite my guilt and error,</p>
<p class="t0">My repenting tears still mirror</p>
<p class="t0">Thy forgiving smile, O Lord.</p>
</div>
<p>The following hymn likewise voices the need for personal perseverance.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Hast to the plow thou put thy hand</p>
<p class="t0">Let not thy spirit waver,</p>
<p class="t0">Heed not the world&rsquo;s allurements grand,</p>
<p class="t0">Nor pause for Sodom&rsquo;s favor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_146">[146]</div>
<p class="t0">But plow thy furrow, sow the seed,</p>
<p class="t0">Though tares and thorns thy work impede;</p>
<p class="t0">For they, who sow with weeping,</p>
<p class="t0">With joy shall soon be reaping.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But should at times thy courage fail&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">For all may fail and falter&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Let not the tempting world prevail</p>
<p class="t0">On thee thy course to alter.</p>
<p class="t0">Each moment lost in faint retreat</p>
<p class="t0">May bring disaster and defeat.</p>
<p class="t0">If foes bid thee defiance,</p>
<p class="t0">On God be thy reliance.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">If steadfast in the race we keep,</p>
<p class="t0">Our course is soon completed.</p>
<p class="t0">And death itself is but a sleep,</p>
<p class="t0">Its dreaded might defeated.</p>
<p class="t0">But those who conquer in the strife</p>
<p class="t0">Obtain the victor&rsquo;s crown of life</p>
<p class="t0">And shall in constant gladness</p>
<p class="t0">Forget these days of sadness.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, in his numerous hymns on Christian trust, comfort
and hope that Grundtvig reaches his highest. His contributions
to this type of hymns are too numerous to be more than indicated
here. But the hymn given below presents a fair example of
the simplicity and poetic beauty that characterize many of them.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">God&rsquo;s little child, what troubles you!</p>
<p class="t0">Think of your Heavenly Father true.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Birds with a song toward heaven soar,</p>
<p class="t0">Neither they reap nor lay in store,</p>

<p class="t3">The Lord be praised!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Clad are the flowers in raiment fair,</p>
<p class="t0">Wondrous to see on deserts bare.</p>
<p class="t0">Neither they spin nor weave nor sew</p>

</div>
<p>Grundtvig&rsquo;s friends were sometimes called the &ldquo;Merry Christians.&rdquo;
There was nothing superficial or lighthearted, however,
about the Christianity of their leader. It had been gained through
intense struggles and maintained at the cost of worldly position and
honor. But he did believe that God is love, and that love is the
root and fount of life, as he says in the following splendid hymn.
The translation is by the Reverend Doving.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Love, the fount of light from heaven,</p>
<p class="t0">Is the root and source of life;</p>
<p class="t0">Therefore God&rsquo;s decrees are given</p>
<p class="t0">With His lovingkindness rife.</p>
<p class="t0">As our Savior blest declareth</p>
<p class="t0">And the Spirit witness beareth,</p>
<p class="t0">As we in God&rsquo;s service prove;</p>
<p class="t0">God is light and God is love.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Love, the crown of life eternal,</p>
<p class="t0">Love the brightness is of light;</p>
<p class="t0">Therefore on His throne supernal</p>
<p class="t0">Jesus sits in glory bright.</p>
<p class="t0">He the Light and Life of heaven,</p>
<p class="t0">Who Himself for us hath given,</p>
<p class="t0">Still abides and reigns above</p>
<p class="t0">In His Father&rsquo;s boundless love.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Love, alone the law fulfilling,</p>
<p class="t0">Is the bond of perfectness;</p>
<p class="t0">Love, who came, a victim willing,</p>
<p class="t0">Wrought our peace and righteousness.</p>
<p class="t0">Therefore love and peace in union</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_148">[148]</div>
<p class="t0">Ever work in sweet communion</p>
<p class="t0">That through love we may abide</p>
<p class="t0">One with Him who for us died.</p>
</div>
<p>But the fruit of God&rsquo;s love is peace. As Grundtvig, in the
hymn above, sings of God&rsquo;s love, so in the sweet hymn given below
he sings of God&rsquo;s peace. The translation is by Pastor Doving.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Peace to soothe our bitter woes</p>
<p class="t0">God in Christ on us bestows;</p>
<p class="t0">Jesus wrought our peace with God</p>
<p class="t0">Through His holy, precious blood;</p>

<p class="t0">This blessed peace our Lord will give</p>
<p class="t0">To all who in His Spirit live.</p>
<p class="t0">And even at their dying breath</p>

</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When Christ for us His peace hath won</p>
<p class="t0">He asked for faith and faith alone.</p>
<p class="t0">By faith and not by merits vain,</p>
<p class="t0">Our hearts God&rsquo;s blessed peace obtain.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Peace be with you, our Savior saith</p>
<p class="t0">In answer to the word of faith.</p>

<p class="t0">And dwell in God&rsquo;s eternal peace.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_149">[149]</div>
<p>Grundtvig&rsquo;s hymns of comfort for the sick and dying rank with
the finest ever written. He hates and fears death, hoping even that
Christ may return before his own hour comes; but if He does not,
he prays that the Savior will be right with him.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lord, when my final hours impend,</p>
<p class="t0">Come in the person of a friend</p>
<p class="t0">And take Thy place beside me,</p>

<p class="t0">Of where we soon shall meet again</p>
<p class="t0">And all Thy joy betide me.</p>

<p>For though he knows he cannot master the enemy alone, if the
Savior is there&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Death is but the last pretender</p>
<p class="t0">We with Christ as our defender</p>
<p class="t0">Shall engage and put to flight.</p>
</div>
<p>And His word will dispel all fear of the struggle:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Like dew upon the meadow</p>
<p class="t0">So falls the word of life</p>
<p class="t0">On Christians in the shadow</p>
<p class="t0">Of mortal&rsquo;s final strife.</p>
<p class="t0">The first fruit of its blessing</p>
<p class="t0">Is balm for fears distressing,</p>
<p class="t0">So gone is like a breath</p>
<p class="t0">The bitterness of death.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Like sun, when night is falling,</p>
<p class="t0">Sets stilly in the west</p>
<p class="t0">While birds are softly calling</p>
<p class="t0">Each other from their nest,</p>
<p class="t0">So when its brief day closes</p>
<p class="t0">That soul in peace reposes</p>

<div id="c16" title="Grundtvig&rsquo;s Later Years">
<h4>Chapter Sixteen
<span class="chaptertitle">Grundtvig&rsquo;s Later Years</span></h4>
<p>Grundtvig&rsquo;s later years present a striking contrast to
the years of his earlier manhood. The lonely Defender of the
Bible became a respected sage and the acknowledged leader of
a fast growing religious and folk movement, both in Denmark and
the other Scandinavian countries. His long years of continuous
struggles were followed by years of fruitful work and an extensive
growth of his religious and educational ideals until he was generally
recognized as one of the most vital spiritual leaders of Scandinavia.</p>
<p>The first break in the wall of isolation that surrounded him
came with an invitation from a group of students to &ldquo;the excellent
historian, N. F. S. Grundtvig, who has never asked for a reward
but only for a chance to do good,&rdquo; to deliver a series of historical
lectures at Borch&rsquo;s Collegium in Copenhagen. These lectures&mdash;seventy-one
in all&mdash;were delivered before packed audiences during
the summer and fall of 1838, and were so enthusiastically received
that the students, on the evening of the concluding lecture, arranged
a splendid banquet for the speaker, at which one of them sang:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Yes, through years of lonely struggle</p>
<p class="t0">Did you bravely fight,</p>
<p class="t0">Bearing scorn without complaining</p>
<p class="t0">Till your hair turned white.</p>
</div>
<p>During his most lonely years Grundtvig once comforted himself
with the words of a Greek sage: &ldquo;Speak to the people of yesterday,
and you will be heard by the people of tomorrow.&rdquo; Thus it
<span class="pb" id="pg_151">[151]</span>
was, no doubt, a great satisfaction to him that the first public honor
bestowed upon him should be accorded him by his nation&rsquo;s youth.</p>
<p>From that day his reputation and influence grew steadily. He
became an honored member of several influential societies, such as
the Society for Northern Studies, and the Scandinavian Society, an
association of academicians from all the Scandinavian countries for
the purpose of effecting a closer spiritual and cultural union between
them. He also received frequent invitations to lecture both
on outstanding occasions and before special groups. His work as
a lecturer probably reached its culmination at a public meeting on
the Skamlingsbanke, a wooded hill on the borders of Slesvig,
where he spoke to thousands of profoundly stirred listeners, and at
a great meeting of Scandinavian students at Oslo, Norway, in 1851,
to which he was invited as the guest of honor and acclaimed both
by the students and the Norwegian people. When Denmark became
a constitutional kingdom in 1848, he was a member of the
constitutional assembly and was elected several times to the Riksdag.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he worked ceaselessly for the development of his
folk and educational ideals. After his conversion, he felt for a
time that his new outlook was incompatible with his previous enthusiasm
for the heroic life and ideals of the old North, and that he
must now devote himself solely to the preaching of the Gospel. But
the formerly mentioned decline of all phases of Danish life during
the early part of the nineteenth century and the failure of his
preaching to evoke any response from an indifferent people caused
him to suspect a closer relationship between a people&rsquo;s religious
and national or folk-life than he had hitherto recognized. Was not
the folk life of a people, after all, the soil in which the Word of God
must be sown, and could the Word bear fruit in a soil completely
hardened and unprepared to receive it? If it could not, was not a
folk awakening a necessary preparation for a Christian?</p>
<p>Under the spur of this question he undertook the translation
of the sagas and developed his now widely recognized ideas of folk
life and folk education, which later were embodied in the Grundtvigian
folk schools. The first of these schools was opened at R&oslash;dding,
Slesvig in 1844. The war between Denmark and Germany
from 1848 to 1850 delayed the establishment of other similar
schools. But in 1851, Christian Kold, the man who more than any
other realized Grundtvig&rsquo;s idea of a school for life&mdash;as the folk
schools were frequently called&mdash;opened his first school at Ryslinge,
<span class="pb" id="pg_152">[152]</span>
Fyn. From there the movement spread rapidly not only to all
parts of Denmark but also to Norway, Finland and Sweden. The
latter country now has more schools of the Grundtvigian type than
Denmark, and Norway and Finland have about have as
many.<sup><a id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>To extend the influence of the movement lecture societies,
reading circles, gymnastic societies, choral groups and the like
were organized in almost every parish of Denmark. Thus before
Grundtvig died, he had the satisfaction of seeing his work bear
fruit in one of the most vital folk and educational movements of
Scandinavia, a movement which has made a tremendous imprint
upon all phases of life in the Northern countries and which today
is spreading to many other parts of the world.</p>
<p>Grundtvig held that the life of a nation, Christian as well as
national, never rose above the real culture of its common people.
To be real, a culture had to be national, had to be based on a
people&rsquo;s natural characteristics and developed in accordance with
native history and traditions. The aim of all true folk-education
was the awakening and enrichment of life and not a mere mental
or practical training. The natural means for the attainment of
this aim was a living presentation of a people&rsquo;s own cultural heritage,
their native tradition, history, literature and folk life. But
in all cases the medium of this presentation was the living, that is
the spoken word by men and women who were themselves spiritually
alive. Christianity, in his opinion, had not come to destroy
but to cleanse and vivify the folk life of a people, and, since the
latter was the soil in which the former had to grow, the fruitfulness
of both demanded a living inter-action so that national life
might become Christian and Christianity national.</p>
<p>In the practical application of these educational theories,
Grundtvig took no active part. Aside from his conception of the
idea and the development of much of the material used in the folk-school,
his greatest contributions to their work are probably, his innumerable
Biblical, historical and folk songs that were and are
used in the schools.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he by no means neglected his religious work. Rationalism
had been defeated, a sound Evangelical movement was
fast revitalizing the church, and he could therefore concentrate
his energy on a further development of the view that had come to
him during his years of struggle. Among innumerable other works,
he produced during his later years the splendid <b>Enlightenment of
the Church</b>, published 1840-1844; <b>Teachings of Our Christian Childhood</b>,
<span class="pb" id="pg_153">[153]</span>
published 1855-1862; <b>The Seven Stars of the Churches</b>, published
1854-1855; and <b>The Church Mirror</b>, a series of lectures on
the main currents of church history, published 1861-1863.</p>
<p>Although Grundtvig&rsquo;s views, and especially his distinction between
the &ldquo;living&rdquo; and the &ldquo;written&rdquo; word, were strongly opposed
by many, his profoundly spiritual conception of the church, as the
body of Christ, and of the sacraments, as its true means of life, has
greatly influenced all branches of the Danish church. In emphasizing
the true indwelling of Christ in the creed and sacraments, he
visualized the real presence of Him in the church and underscored
the vital center of congregational worship with a realism that no
theological dissertation can ever convey. Nor did he feel that in
so doing he was in any sense diverging from true Lutheranism. The
fact that Luther himself chose the creed and the words of institution
of the sacrament as a basis for his catechism, showed, he contended,
that the great Reformer also had recognized their distinction.</p>
<p>Despite frequent charges to the contrary, Grundtvig had no desire
to engender a separatist movement in the church. He constantly
warned his followers against any such tendency. In a closing
speech to the Meeting of Friends in 1863, he said, &ldquo;You can no
more forbid the world to call you Grundtvigians than those whom
Luther called to the Lord could forbid anyone to call them Lutherans,
but do not yourself adopt that name. For history shows that
some have let themselves be called Lutherans until they have almost
lost the name of Christians. If anyone wishes to name us
after any other than Christ, we ought to tell them that we accept
nothing unto salvation except what the Christian church has taught
and confessed from generation to generation. To or from that we
neither add nor detract. We acknowledge without reservation
that word of faith which Paul says is believed to righteousness and
confessed unto salvation. The manner of teaching and believing
that faith so that the Old Adam may be put off and the new put on,
we hold to be a matter of enlightenment in which we shall be guided
by Grundtvig, as we are guided by Luther, only in so far as we
are convinced that he has been guided by Scripture and the Spirit.
We also disclaim any intention of making our conception of Scripture
an article of faith which must be accepted by the church.&rdquo;
Grundtvig&rsquo;s followers would, no doubt, have profited greatly by
remembering this truly liberal view of their leader.</p>
<p>Thus his years passed quietly onward, filled with fruitful labor
<span class="pb" id="pg_154">[154]</span>
even unto the end. In contrast to his often stormy public career,
Grundtvig&rsquo;s private life was quite peaceful and commonplace,
subject only to the usual trials and sorrows of human existence.
During the greater part of his life he was extremely poor, subsisting
on a small government pension, the meager returns from his
writings and occasional gifts from friends. For his own part this
did not trouble him; his wants were few and easily satisfied. But
he &ldquo;liked to see shining faces around him,&rdquo; as he once wrote, and
he had discovered that the face of a child could often be brightened
by a small gift, which he was frequently too poor to give. &ldquo;But if
we would follow the Lord in these days,&rdquo; he wrote to a friend, &ldquo;we
must evidently be prepared to renounce all things for His sake
and cast out all these heathen worries for dross and chaff with
which we as Christians often distress ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grundtvig was thrice married. His first wife, Lise Grundtvig,
died January 4, 1851, after a long illness. Her husband said at her
grave, &ldquo;I stand here as an old man who is taking a decided step
toward my own grave by burying the bride of my youth and the
mother of my children who for more than forty years with unfailing
loyalty shared all my joys and sorrows&mdash;and mostly latter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Grundtvig did not appear to be growing old. During the
following summer he attended the great meeting of Scandinavian
students at Oslo, where he was hailed as the youngest of them all.
And on October 4 of the same year, he rejoiced his enemies and
grieved many of his friends by marrying Marie Toft, of Rennebeck&rsquo;s
Manor, a wealthy widow and his junior by thirty years.
And despite dire predictions to the contrary, the marriage was
very happy. Marie Toft was a highly intelligent and spiritual-minded
woman who wholeheartedly shared her husband&rsquo;s spiritual
views and ideals; and her death in 1854 came, therefore, as an
almost overwhelming blow. In a letter to a friend a few weeks
after her death, Grundtvig writes, &ldquo;It was wonderful to be loved
as unselfishly as Marie loved me. But she belonged wholly to God.
He gave and He took; and despite all objections by the world and
our own selfish flesh, the believing heart must exclaim, His name
be praised. When I consider the greatness of the treasure that the
Lord gave to me by opening this loving heart to me in my old age,
I confess that it probably would have proved beyond my strength
continuously to bear such good days; for had I not already become
critical of all that were not like her, and indifferent to all things
that were not concerned with her?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_155">[155]</div>
<p>The last remark, perhaps, refers to a complaint by his friends
that he had become so absorbed in his wife that he neglected other
things. If this had been the case, he now made amends by throwing
himself into a whirl of activity that would have taxed the
strength of a much younger man. During the following years, he
wrote part of his formerly mentioned books on the church and
Christian education, delivered a large number of lectures, resumed
his seat in the Riksdag and, of course, attended to his growing work
as a pastor. As he was also very neglectful of his own comfort in
other ways, it was evident to all that such a strenuous life must
soon exhaust his strength unless someone could be constantly about
him and minister to his need. For this reason a high-minded young
widow, the Baroness Asta Tugendreich Reetz, entered into marriage
with him that she might help to conserve the strength of the
man whom she considered one of the greatest assets her country
possessed.</p>
<p>Grundtvig once said of his marriages that the first was an idyl,
the second a romance and the third a fairy-tale. Others said harsher
things. But Asta Grundtvig paid no attention to the scandal
mongers. A very earnest Christian woman herself, she devoted
all her energy to create a real Christian home for her husband and
family. As Grundtvig had always lived much by himself, she
wished especially to make their home a ready gathering place for
all his friends and co-workers. In this she succeeded so well that
their modest dwelling was frequently crowded with visitors from
far and near, many of whom later counted their visit with Grundtvig
among the richest experiences of their life.</p>
<p>Grundtvig&rsquo;s fiftieth anniversary as a pastor was celebrated
with impressive festivities on May 29, 1861. The celebration was
attended by representatives from all departments of government
and the church as well as by a host of people from all parts of
Scandinavia; and the celebrant was showered with gifts and honors.
The king conferred upon him the title of bishop; the former queen,
Carolina Amalia, presented him with a seven armed candlestick of
gold from women in Norway, Sweden and Denmark; his friend,
Pastor P. A. Fenger, handed him a gift of three thousand dollars
from friends in Denmark and Norway to finance a popular edition
of his <b>Hymns and Songs for the Danish Church</b>; and another
friend, Gunni Busck, presented him with a plaque of gold engraved
with his likeness and a line from his hymns, a gift from the congregation
of Vartov.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_156">[156]</div>
<p>Many of those who participated in this splendid jubilee felt
that it would be of great benefit to them to meet again for mutual
fellowship and discussion of pressing religious and national questions.
And with the willing cooperation of Asta Grundtvig, it was
decided to invite all who might be interested to a meeting in Copenhagen
on Grundtvig&rsquo;s eightieth birthday, September 8, the following
year. This Meeting of Friends&mdash;as it was named&mdash;proved so
successful that it henceforth became an annual event, attended by
people from all parts of Scandinavia. Although Grundtvig earnestly
desired that these meetings should actually be what they were
designed to be, meetings of friends for mutual help and enlightenment,
his own part in them was naturally important. His powers
were still unimpaired, and his contributions were rich in wisdom
and spiritual insight. Knowing himself surrounded by friends, he
often spoke with an appealing heartiness and power that made the
Meetings of Friends unforgettable experiences to many.</p>
<p>Thus the once loneliest man in Denmark found himself in his
old age honored by his nation, surrounded by friends, and besieged
by visitors and co-workers, seeking his help and advice. He was
always very approachable. In his younger days he had frequently
been harsh and self-assertive in his judgment of others; but in his
latter years he learned that kindness is always more fruitful than
wrath. Sitting in his easy chair and smoking his long pipe, he
talked frankly and often wittily with the many who came to visit
him. Thus Bishop H. Martensen, the theologian, tells us that his
conversation was admirably eloquent and interspersed with wit
and humor. And a prominent Swedish author, P. Wisselgren,
writes: &ldquo;Some years ago I spent one of the most delightful evenings
of my life with Bishop Grundtvig. I doubt that I have ever
met a greater poet of conversation. Each thought was an inspiration
and his heart was in every word he said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grundtvig&rsquo;s outward appearance, especially during his later
years, was extremely charming. His strong countenance framed
by long white locks and a full beard bore the imprint of a profound
spiritual intellect and a benevolent calmness. The queen, Caroline
Amalia, after her first meeting with him wrote, &ldquo;Grundtvig
has a most beautiful countenance, and he attracted me at once by
his indescribably kind and benevolent appearance. What an interesting
man he is, and what a pleasure it is to listen to his open
and forthright conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so, still active and surrounded by friends, he saw his long,
<span class="pb" id="pg_157">[157]</span>
fruitful life drawing quietly toward its close. In 1871, he opened
the annual Meeting of Friends by speaking from the text: &ldquo;See, I
die, but the Lord shall be with you,&rdquo; and said in all likelihood this
meeting would be the last at which he would be present. He lived,
however, to prepare for the next meeting, which was to be held on
September 11, 1872. On September 1, he conducted his service at
Vartov as usual, preaching an exceptionally warm and inspiring
sermon. But the following morning he passed away quietly while
sitting in his easy chair and listening to his son read for him.</p>
<p>He was buried September 11, three days after his 89th birthday,
in the presence of representatives from all departments of the
government, one fourth of the Danish clergy and a vast assembly
of people from all parts of Scandinavia.</p>
<p>An American writer recently named Grundtvig &ldquo;The Builder
of Modern Denmark.&rdquo; And there are few phases of modern Danish
life which he has not influenced. His genius was so unique and
his work so many-sided that with equal justice one might call him
a historian, a poet, an educator, a religious philosopher, a hymnologist
and a folk-leader. Yet there is an underlying unity of thought
and purpose in all his work which makes each part of it merely a
branch of the whole. This underlying unity is his clear conception
of the spiritual and of man as a spiritual being who can attain his
fullest development only through the widest possible realization
of the spiritual in all his divine and human relationships. In every
part of his work Grundtvig, therefore, invariably seeks to discover
the spiritual realities. The mere form of a thing, the form of religion,
of knowledge, of education, of government, of all human institutions
and endeavors have no intrinsic value, are only skeletons
and dead bones until they become imbued and vivified by the spirit.
Thus Professor Martensen, who by no means belonged to the
Grundtvigian party, writes, &ldquo;But among the many things I owe to
Grundtvig, I cherish above all his conception of the spiritual as
the reality besides which all other things are nothing but shadows,
and of the spirit inspired word as the mightiest power in human
life. And he gave that to me not as a theory but as a living truth,
a spiritual reality about which there could be not even a shadow
of doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grundtvig found the spiritual in many things, in the myth of
the North, in history, literature and, in fact, in all things through
which man has to express his god-given nature. He had no patience
with the Pietists who looked upon all things not directly religious
<span class="pb" id="pg_158">[158]</span>
as evils with which a Christian could have nothing to do. Yet he
believed above all in the Holy Spirit as the &ldquo;Spirit of spirits,&rdquo; the
true agent of God in the world. The work of the Spirit was indispensable
to man&rsquo;s salvation, and the fruit of that work, the regenerated
Christian life, the highest expression of the spiritual. Since
he believed furthermore, that the Holy Spirit works especially in
the church through the word and sacraments, the church was to
him the workshop of the Spirit.</p>
<p>In his famous hymn to the church bell, his symbol for the
church, he writes &ldquo;that among all noble voices none could compare
with that of the ringing bell.&rdquo; Despite the many fields in which
he traced the imprint of the spiritual, the church remained throughout
his long life his real spiritual home, a fact which he beautifully
expresses in the hymn below.</p>

<h2>Other Danish Hymnwriters</h2>
<div class="pb" id="pg_161">[161]</div>
<div id="c17" title="Other Danish Hymnwriters">
<h4><span class="sectitle">Chapter Seventeen</span></h4>
<p>The Danish church has produced a large number of hymnwriters,
who, except for the greatness of Kingo, Brorson and
Grundtvig, would have commanded general recognition. The
present hymnal of the church contains contributions by about
sixty Danish writers. Though the majority of these are represented
by only one or two hymns, others have made large contributions.</p>
<p>Kingo, Brorson and Grundtvig, peculiarly enough, had few
imitators. A small number of writers did attempt to imitate the
great leaders, but they formed no school and their work for the
most part was so insignificant that it soon disappeared. Thus even
Kingo&rsquo;s great work inspired no hymnwriter of any consequence,
and the fifty years between Kingo and Brorson added almost nothing
to the hymnody of the church. Contemporary with Brorson,
however, a few writers appeared whose songs have survived to
the present day. Foremost among these is Ambrosius Stub, a
unique and sympathetic writer whose work constitutes a distinct
contribution to Danish poetry.</p>
<div id="stub_a" title="Ambrosius Stub">
<p>Ambrosius Stub was born on the island of Fyn in 1705, the
son of a village tailor. Although extremely poor, he managed
somehow to enter the University of Copenhagen, but his poverty
compelled him to leave the school without completing his course.
For a number of years, he drifted aimlessly, earning a precarious
living by teaching or bookkeeping at the estates of various nobles,
always dogged by poverty and a sense of frustration. Although
he was gifted and ambitious, his lack of a degree and his continuous
poverty prevented him from attaining the position in life to which
his ability apparently entitled him. During his later years, he conducted
a small school for boys at Ribe, a small city on the west
coast of Jutland, where he died in abject poverty in 1758, only 53
years old.</p>
<p>Stub&rsquo;s work remained almost unknown during his lifetime,
but a small collection of his poems, published after his death,
gained him a posthumous recognition as the greatest Danish poet
of the 18th century. Stub&rsquo;s style is extremely noble and expressive,
devoid of the excessive bombast and sentimentality that many writers
then mistook for poetry. He was of a cheerful disposition with
a hopeful outlook upon life that only occasionally is darkened by
<span class="pb" id="pg_162">[162]</span>
the hardships and disappointments of his own existence. Even the
poems of his darker moods are colored by his inborn love of beauty
and his belief in the fundamental goodness of life. Many of his best
poems are of a religious nature, and expressive of his warm and
trustful Christian faith. In view of the discouraging hardships and
disappointments of his own life, the following much favored hymn
throws a revealing light upon the spirit of its author.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Undismayed by any fortune</p>
<p class="t0">Life may have in store for me,</p>
<p class="t0">This, whatever be my portion,</p>
<p class="t0">I will always try to be.</p>

<div id="rational" title="Rationalist Hymnwriters">
<p>The age of Rationalism discarded most of the old hymns but
produced no worthwhile hymns of its own. The most highly
praised hymnwriter of the period, Birgitte Boye, the wife of a forester,
wrote a great number of hymns of which no less than 150
were included in a new hymnal published in 1870, by the renowned
<span class="pb" id="pg_163">[163]</span>
statesman, Ove Hoegh Guldberg. Although excessively praised
by the highest authorities of the period, Birgitte Boye&rsquo;s hymns contain
nothing of permanent value, and have now happily been forgotten.</p>
</div>
<div id="boye_cj" title="Casper J. Boye">
<p>The Evangelical revival about the middle of the 19th century
restored the old hymns to their former favor, and produced besides,
a number of new hymnwriters of real merit. Among these, Casper
J. Boye is, perhaps, the most prominent. Born of Danish parents
at Kongsberg, Norway, in 1791, Boye entered the University of
Copenhagen in 1820 where he first took up the study of law and
then, of theology. After graduating from this department, he became
a teacher at a Latin school and some years later, a pastor of
the large Garrison Church in Copenhagen, where he remained until
his death in 1851. Boye was a gifted writer, both on secular and
religious themes. His numerous hymns appeared in six small volumes
entitled: <b>Spiritual Songs</b>. They are marked by a flowing but
at times excessively literary style and a quiet spiritual fervor. The
following still is a favorite opening hymn.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Day is breaking, night is ended,</p>
<p class="t0">And the day of rest ascended</p>
<p class="t0">Upon church and countryside.</p>
<p class="t0">Like the day in brightness growing,</p>
<p class="t0">Grace from God is richer flowing;</p>
<p class="t0">Heaven&rsquo;s portals open wide.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O what joy this day is bringing,</p>
<p class="t0">When the chiming bells are ringing,</p>
<p class="t0">Calling man to prayer and praise!</p>
<p class="t0">All the angel host rejoices</p>
<p class="t0">And with gladsome, mellow voices</p>
<p class="t0">Thanks the Lord for light and grace.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Sin and death with fear and sorrow</p>
<p class="t0">And the burden of tomorrow</p>
<p class="t0">Shall not weigh my heart with care.</p>
<p class="t0">Unto all in tribulation</p>
<p class="t0">Doth the Lord of our salvation</p>
<p class="t0">On this day His peace declare.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Be it hushed in solemn stillness,</p>
<p class="t0">Must I weep in grief or illness,</p>
<p class="t0">Or confess my guilt and shame,</p>
<p class="t0">It is blessed to be weeping</p>
<p class="t0">When the hungry heart is reaping</p>
<p class="t0">Grace and peace in Jesus&rsquo; name.</p>

<p class="t0">Till before Thy throne we stand.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="timm_ha" title="Herman Andreas Timm">
<p>Herman Andreas Timm, a younger contemporary of Boye, also
wrote a large number of excellent hymns. He was born at Copenhagen
in 1800, and was for many years pastor of the church on
Amager, a suburb of the capital city. He died in 1866. His hymns
appeared in a small volume of poems, published in 1834, under the
title: <b>Spiritual Songs</b>. They are characterized by an easy literary
style and an urgent spiritual appeal. The following very popular
hymn is perhaps the best-known of those now available in English.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Dost thou know the living fountain</p>
<p class="t0">Whence the stream of grace doth flow?</p>
<p class="t0">Dry the streams from snowcapped mountain,</p>
<p class="t0">Yet this stream shall fuller grow.</p>
<p class="t0">From the very heart of God</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="oldenburg" title="Theodore Vilhelm Oldenburg">
<div class="pb" id="pg_165">[165]</div>
<p>Another contemporary of these writers, and perhaps the most
prominent of the group, was Theodore Vilhelm Oldenburg. Oldenburg
was born at Copenhagen in 1805, son of the Royal Chamberlain,
Frederik Oldenburg. His mother died while he was still a
boy, but his excellent father managed to give him a most careful
training and a splendid education. He graduated &ldquo;cum laude&rdquo; from
the University of Copenhagen in 1822, obtained the degree of Master
of Arts during the following year, entered the department of
theology and graduated from there three years later, also &ldquo;cum
laude.&rdquo; In 1830 he accepted a call to become pastor of the parish
of Otterup and Sorterup on the island of Fyn. Here he won high
praise for his conspicuously able and faithful work. Together with
the gifted Bishop P. C. Kirkegaard, he was editor for a number of
years of the influential periodical &ldquo;Nordisk Tidsskrift for Kristelig
Teologi,&rdquo; and also of the outstanding foreign mission paper, &ldquo;Dansk
Missionsblad.&rdquo; Through these papers he exerted a powerful and
always beneficent influence upon the churches of both Denmark
and Norway. His outstanding and richly blest service was cut
short by death in 1842 when he was only 37 years old. He was carried
to the grave to the strains of his own appealing hymn: &ldquo;Thine,
O Jesus, Thine Forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oldenburg&rsquo;s quite numerous hymns were printed from time
to time in various periodicals. They express in a noble and highly
lyrical style the firm faith and warm religious fervor of his own
consecrated life.</p>
<p>The hymn given below was written for a foreign mission convention
shortly before his death.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Deep and precious,</p>
<p class="t0">Strong and gracious</p>
<p class="t0">Is the word of God above,</p>
<p class="t0">Gently calling</p>

</div>
<div id="ingemann" title="Bernhard Severin Ingemann">
<p>Besides Grundtvig the foremost hymnwriter of this period was
his close friend, Bernhard Severin Ingemann, one of Denmark&rsquo;s
most popular and beloved writers. He was born in 1789 in a parsonage
on the island of Falster. His father died in 1800 when the
son was only 11 years old, and his mother left the parsonage to
settle in Slagelse, an old city on the island of Sj&aelig;lland. Having
graduated from the Latin school there in 1806, Ingemann entered
the University of Copenhagen in the fall of the same year. During
the English attack on Copenhagen in 1807, he enrolled in the student&rsquo;s
volunteer corps and fought honorably in defense of the city.
After graduating from the University, he was granted free board
and room at Walkendorf&rsquo;s Collegium, an institution for the aid of
indigent but promising young students. Here he devoted most of
his time to literary pursuits and, during the following three years,
he published a large number of works which won him a favorable
name as a gifted lyrical poet of a highly idealistic type. As an encouragement
to further efforts, the government granted him a two
year stipend for travel and study in foreign parts. He visited Germany,
France, Switzerland and Italy, and became acquainted with
many famous literary leaders of that day, especially in Germany.
On his return from abroad in 1822 he was appointed a lector at
the famous school at Sor&oslash; on the island of Sj&aelig;lland. In this charming
old city with its splendid cathedral and idyllic surroundings he
spent the remainder of his life in the peace and quiet that agreed
so well with his own mild and seraphic nature. He died in 1862.</p>
<p>Inspired by Oehlenschlaeger and strongly encouraged by
Grundtvig, Ingemann in 1824 began the issuance of his famous historical
novels, based upon episodes from the romantic period of
Danish history during the 13th and 14th centuries. To some extent
the novels are modeled upon the similar works of Walter Scott but
are written in a livelier style and more idealistic spirit than their
English prototype. In later years their historical veracity has been
gravely questioned. Enjoying an immense popularity both in Denmark
and in Norway, these highly idealized pictures of the past
<span class="pb" id="pg_167">[167]</span>
did much to arouse that national spirit which especially Grundtvig
had labored long to awaken. After completing his historical novels,
Ingemann again resumed his lyrical and fictional writings, producing
a large number of poems, fairy-tales and novels that further
increased his already immense popularity.</p>
<div class="img" title="Bernhard Severin Ingemann">
<img height="592" width="500" alt="Bernhard Severin Ingemann" src="images/ingemann.png" />
<p class="center">Bernhard Severin Ingemann</p>
</div>
<p>Despite the great popularity of Ingemann&rsquo;s secular writings,
it is, nevertheless, his hymns and spiritual songs which will preserve
his name the longest. His first collection of hymns, a small volume
of morning and evening songs, appeared in 1822. This collection
was followed in 1825 by a volume of church hymns, which was enlarged
and reprinted in 1843. The favorable reception of these
hymns caused Ingemann to be selected to prepare the new church
hymnal, published in 1855, a task which he accomplished to the
general satisfaction of all.</p>
<p>Ingemann&rsquo;s hymns faithfully reflect his own serene and idealistic
nature. Their outstanding merits are a limpid, lyrical style
and an implicit trust in the essential goodness of life and its Author.
<span class="pb" id="pg_168">[168]</span>
Of Kingo&rsquo;s realistic conception of evil or Grundtvig&rsquo;s mighty vision
of existence as a heroic battle between life and death, he has little
understanding. The world of his songs is as peaceful and idyllic
as the quiet countryside around his beloved Sor&oslash;. If at times he
tries to take the deeper note, his voice falters and becomes artificial.
But though his hymns on such themes as sin and redemption
are largely a failure, he has written imperishable hymns of idealistic
faith and childlike trust in the goodness and love of God.</p>
<p>The extreme lyrical quality and highly involved and irregular
metre of many of Ingemann&rsquo;s hymns make them extremely
difficult to translate, and their English translations fail on the
whole to do justice. The translation given below is perhaps one of
the best. It is the work of the Rev. P. C. Paulsen.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">As wide as the skies is Thy mercy, O God;</p>
<p class="t0">Thy faithfulness shieldeth creation.</p>
<p class="t0">Thy bounteous hand from the mountains abroad</p>
<p class="t0">Is stretched over country and nation.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Like heaven&rsquo;s embrace is Thy mercy, O Lord;</p>
<p class="t0">In judgment profound Thou appearest.</p>
<p class="t0">Thou savest our souls through Thy life-giving word,</p>
<p class="t0">The cries of Thy children Thou hearest.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">How precious Thy goodness, O Father above,</p>
<p class="t0">Where children of men are abiding.</p>
<p class="t0">Thou spreadest through darkness the wings of Thy love;</p>
<p class="t0">We under their pinions are hiding.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">For languishing souls Thou preparest a rest;</p>
<p class="t0">The quivering dove Thou protectest;</p>
<p class="t0">Thou givest us being, eternal and blest,</p>
<p class="t0">In mercy our life Thou perfectest.</p>
</div>
<p>The following hymn is also quite popular.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The sun is rising in the east,</p>
<p class="t0">It gilds the heavens wide,</p>
<p class="t0">And scatters light on mountain crest,</p>
<p class="t0">On shore and countryside.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">It rises from the valley bright,</p>
<p class="t0">Where Paradise once lay,</p>
<p class="t0">And bringeth life, and joy and light</p>
<p class="t0">To all upon its way.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">It greets us from the land afar</p>
<p class="t0">Where man with grace was crowned,</p>
<p class="t0">And from that wondrous Morning Star,</p>
<p class="t0">Which Eastern sages found.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The starry host bow down before</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_169">[169]</div>
<p class="t0">The sun that passes them;</p>
<p class="t0">It seems so like that star of yore</p>
<p class="t0">Which shone on Bethlehem.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thou Sun of Suns, from heaven come,</p>
<p class="t0">In Thee our praises rise</p>
<p class="t0">For every message from Thy home</p>
<p class="t0">And from Thy Paradise.</p>

<p>The most beloved of all Ingemann&rsquo;s hymns is his splendid
&ldquo;Pilgrim Song.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Dejlig er Jorden,</p>
<p class="t0">Pr&aelig;gtig er Guds Himmel,</p>
<p class="t0">Sk&oslash;n er Sj&aelig;lenes Pilgrimsgang.</p>
<p class="t0">Gennem de fagre</p>
<p class="t0">Riger paa Jorden</p>
<p class="t0">Gaa vi til Paradis med Sang.</p>
</div>
<p>This hymn is written to the tune of &ldquo;Beautiful Savior&rdquo; which
Ingemann, in common with many others, accepted as a marching
tune from the period of the crusades. Although this historic origin
has now been disproved, the tune united with Ingemann&rsquo;s text
undoubtedly will remain the most beloved pilgrim song among
the Danish and Norwegian peoples. Though fully aware of the
impossibility of translating this tenderly beautiful song so that it
is acceptable to those who know the original, the author presents
the following translation in the hope that it may interest those who
cannot read the original.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Fair is creation,<sup><a id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p class="t0">Fairer God&rsquo;s heaven,</p>
<p class="t0">Blest is the marching pilgrim throng.</p>
<p class="t0">Onward through lovely</p>
<p class="t0">Regions of beauty</p>
<p class="t0">Go we to Paradise with song.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Ages are coming,</p>
<p class="t0">Ages are passing</p>
<p class="t0">Nations arise and disappear.</p>
<p class="t0">Never the joyful</p>
<p class="t0">Message from heaven</p>
<p class="t0">Wanes through the soul&rsquo;s brief sojourn here.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Angels proclaimed it</p>
<p class="t0">Once to the shepherds,</p>
<p class="t0">Henceforth from soul to soul it passed:</p>
<p class="t0">Unto all people</p>
<p class="t0">Peace and rejoicing,</p>
<p class="t0">Us is a Savior born at last.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_170">[170]</div>
<p>Of other hymns by Ingemann, which are now available in English,
we may mention &ldquo;Jesus, My Savior, My Shepherd Blest,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Country Lies in Deep Repose&rdquo; and &ldquo;I Live and I Know the Span
of My Years.&rdquo;</p>

<div id="late19cent" title="Late 19th-Century Hymnwriters">
<p>The last half of the 19th century also brought forth a number
of Danish hymnwriters of considerable merit, such as Chr. Richardt,
Pastor J. P. M. Paulli, Pastor Olfert Ricard and Pastor J. Schjorring.
The latter is especially known by one song which has been
translated into many languages and with which it seems appropriate
to close this survey of Danish hymnody.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Love from God our Lord,</p>
<p class="t0">Has forever poured</p>
<p class="t0">Like a fountain pure and clear.</p>
<p class="t0">In its quiet source,</p>
<p class="t0">In its silent course</p>
<p class="t0">Doth the precious pearl appear.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Love from God our Lord,</p>
<p class="t0">Comes with sweet accord,</p>
<p class="t0">Like a pure and lovely bride.</p>
<p class="t0">Dwell within my heart,</p>
<p class="t0">Peace from God impart,</p>
<p class="t0">Heaven doth with Thee abide.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Love from God our Lord,</p>
<p class="t0">Has to man restored</p>
<p class="t0">Life and peace from heaven above.</p>
<p class="t0">Who in love remains,</p>
<p class="t0">Peace from God obtains;</p>
<p class="t0">God Himself is ever love.</p>
